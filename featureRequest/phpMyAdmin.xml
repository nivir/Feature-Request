        <title>Legacy support for Chinese Database using latin1(ascii) - ID: 1645673</title>
        <detail>There are so many many databases in China/Taiwan region are still running under traditional database. i.e. using latin1 to store big5/gb2312 Chinese text in mysql 3/4/5 because the old program do not using Unicode or specific language setting or other reason.  
 
In phpmyadmin 2.5.7 or before, the phpmyadmin was still running in without unicode base (without conversion), we can still maintenance the database. However after version 2.6 , the backend are running in unicode, we cannot able to view/edit the Chinese because of the text conversion issue and cause big trouble to many user. 
 
So I would like to suggest to add an legacy support to these database.  
 
Base on the current phpmyadmin coding: 
 
1. the available language may be have one more set for the big5-latin1 / gb2312-latin1 for the user to choose. 
 
2. The html tag for the web pages have to be big5 / gb2312 and the connection collation have to be latin1 (back to the traditional). 
 
Finally the data must be displayed as the original text (i.e. no need to convert to Unicode/UTF-8). The Chinese text should be display/edit correctly by web browser. 
 
However the language file use the current big5/gb2312 files should be OK. 
 
Or any other way to force phpmyadmin to run without unicode and no text conversion is also possible. 
 
Thanks.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.5.5) Edit multiple records - ID: 841691</title>
        <detail>One feature which the Usermin MySQL interface has that 
phpMyAdmin does not (and would be very very useful) is 
the ability to select multiple rows to edit at once. 
The Usermin interface gives a set of checkboxes next to 
each row, and puts an &amp;quot;edit&amp;quot; button at the bottom of 
the page to edit all checked rows. It then brings up a 
page which basically contains the standard Edit page, 
but with each row in succession.</detail>

        <title>Warning on use of reserved words - ID: 902123</title>
        <detail>So many new users make the mistake of using a reserved  
word in creating their tables. 
If I had count of the amount of times someone asked me  
why he can't insert into a field he calls &quot;desc&quot; or &quot;before&quot;  
or anything similar... 
 
Possible solution: 
1) Warning on use of reserved word 
 
2) Renaming field automagically when using reserved  
word. 
(#1 is best imho) 
 
Adding this feature is easy enough, the list of reserved  
words is obtained here 
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Reserved_words.html 
And merely checking if fieldname is  
in_array($reserved_words); shouldnt take long to  
execute.</detail>

        <title>(ok 3.4) OpenID integration - ID: 1640812</title>
        <detail>I would love to see OpenID integration in PMA. This could work in three ways that I foresee, perhaps the choice could be offered in the config file. 
 
1. A standard config auth is used, but the OpenID (or array of several IDs) is also included. A user logs in with his/her openid and is logged in using the config user and password vars.  
Pros: simple, wouldn't need much work (relatively speaking) 
Cons: ties the user to a single MySQL username.  
 
2. An associative array in the config file would tie each openid to a single user/password pair. 
Pros: also simple, wouldn't need much more work than option 1, would allow multiple users. 
Cons: still ties each openid to a single MySQL username. 
 
3. The pma database could have a new table to tie openids to particular MySQL logins. 
Pros: same as option 1, would allow for easier editing of openids. 
Cons: same as above, requires more work. 
 
The single user problem here could be worked around by allowing several users per openid, but this would be non-intuitive, would require that the login page offer a choice of users, and would require a crapload of work. 
 
JanRain Inc. already has a PHP openid library to make this easier, so there isn't _much_ work that would need to be done. I would do it myself if I weren't so useless at modifying other people's code. 
 
Another advantage of openid integration is the iwantmyopenid.com bounty of $5,000 to FLOSS projects with large user bases that use openid. I believe PMA is large enough to qualify. :-) 
 
I know that all these have problems, probabally some that I didn't even think of, but the advantage of FLOSS is that everyone can groupthink and come up with a better idea. Anyone have any?</detail>

just copy and paste them in.  it would be nice if  
phpmyadmin handled this with its own store of queries  
you can enter and recall.  this probably shouldn't be  
a real database/table in mysql, because then only  
certain users would be able to use it.</detail>

        <title>Clever CSV import - ID: 1549028</title>
        <detail>I think I could write a better import, but I haven't 
the time, it's too strict, too hard to use, it assumes 
too much of the user, it isn't smart enough to know how 
to shape the table to the data.  
 
It doesn't seemt ot make a first pass at the data to 
determine how to shape the table its importing to. 
 
I had planned to take a CSV extracted from a client's 
XLS file, and dump it directly into a table, then shape 
it down from that, but after reading the source code I 
got the feeling the original coder hacked it end to end 
for a particular kind of csv format.  
 
I like phpMyAdmin, but this code could be improved on 
(A LOT).  I found global vars, localization as global 
strings, localization should probably be a special 
class to avoid variable conflicts in the global scope. 
But that has nothing to do with the problem. I expect 
the code could be reduced by about a third or half what 
&quot;csv.php&quot; is now.  
 
 
Also error checks like: 
 
 
   if (count($values) != $required_fields) { 
                        $message = 
sprintf($strInvalidCSVFieldCount, $line); 
                        $show_error_header = TRUE; 
                        $error = TRUE; 
                        break; 
   } 
 
Is a sign of poor flexibility.. Try never to use !=, 
unless you are dealing with booleans, where the 
likelihood is greater that it will be true or false.  
 
I don't see examples of how to handle the case where 
the csv data is greater or less than..  
 
You will know this is a valid feature when it can 
handle less (space fill), or greater than (truncate or 
expand table).  
 
Otherwise drop the feature, it's useless..</detail>

        <title>(Relation) specify field displayed - ID: 542706</title>
        <detail>It would be great if there were another field in  
the 'relation' table that specified which field in the  
destination table were displayed.  e.g. When linking  
two people id's, it would be more helpful to see the  
person name instead of the id. 
 
I added a column called 'disp_dest_column' to  
my 'relation' table, and added/edited this code in  
libraries/display_tbl.lib.php3 file, and it seems to  
work.  Not perfect, but it's a start. 
 
//when getting the relation map 
$local_query = 'SELECT src_column, dest_table,  
dest_column, disp_dest_column' 
    . ' FROM ' . $cfgServer['relation'] 
    . ' WHERE src_table IN ' . $tabs; 
$result      = @mysql_query($local_query); 
if ($result) { 
    while ($rel = mysql_fetch_row($result)) { 
        $map[$rel[0]] = array($rel[1], $rel[2], $rel 
[3]); 
    } 
} 
 
//when displaying row values 
$dispsql = 'SELECT ' . $map[$primary-&amp;gt;name][2] . '  
FROM ' . PMA_backquote($map[$primary-&amp;gt;name][0]) . '  
WHERE ' . $map[$primary-&amp;gt;name][1] . ' = ' . $row 
[$pointer]; 
$dispresult = mysql_query($dispsql); 
if ($dispresult) { 
    $disprow = mysql_fetch_row($dispresult); 
    $dispval = $disprow[0]; 
} 
else { 
    $dispval = $row[$pointer]; 
} 
 
$vertical_display['data'][$foo][$i] .= '&amp;lt;a  
href=&amp;quot;sql.php3?' 
.  'lang=' . $lang . '&amp;amp;amp;server=' . $server 
.  '&amp;amp;amp;db=' . urlencode($db) . '&amp;amp;amp;table=' .  
urlencode($map[$primary-&amp;gt;name][0]) 
.  '&amp;amp;amp;pos=0&amp;amp;amp;session_max_rows=' .  
$session_max_rows . '&amp;amp;amp;dontlimitchars=' .  
$dontlimitchars 
.  '&amp;amp;amp;sql_query=' . urlencode('SELECT * FROM ' .  
PMA_backquote($map[$primary-&amp;gt;name][0]) . ' WHERE ' .  
$map[$primary-&amp;gt;name][1] . ' = ' . $row 
[$pointer]) . '&amp;quot;&amp;gt;' 
.  $dispval . '&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;'; 
 
 
It would also be great if when editing a row with  
relations, a SELECT menu would be displayed with the  
disp_dest_column values instead of a text input.</detail>

        <title>Please no more popup window for SQL queries!!!! - ID: 2807145</title>
        <detail>Hi there. Thanks for all your hard work. 
 
One thing about phpMyAdmin drives me mad  - it's the sql popup 
window WHICH APPEARS AFTER YOU CLICK ON  THE &quot;SQL&quot; TAB, RUN THE QUERY, AND THEN CLICK &quot;EDIT&quot;. 
Can we get rid of it? Clicking EDIT should replace the SQL query on the page with an editable  textarea, not a popup window  
which means I constantly have to cycle through my browser windows to find out where the SQL query has disappeared to. 
 
To @ibennetch and @lem9  who commented on the original thread: clicking on the SQL tab works only the first time round, after that if you click on 'EDIT' it will launch a popup window (at least on Firefox on OSX,) 
 
Thanks 
P.S: Someone closed the comments on the original thread without understanding the problem or explaining why - how rude.

        <title>exporting multiple row query with variables - ID: 1013336</title>
        <detail>hi,  
exporting the result of multiple queries containing 
variables didn't work (export-link at bottom of 
result-page). 
because sql_query contains only the last query.  
is there any possibility to submit all query elements. 
i.e. 
SET @a=10; SELECT @b:=20; SELECT @a,@b;  
like  
sql_query=SET+%40a%3D10%3B+SELECT+%40b%3A%3D20%3B+SELECT+%40a%2C%40b%3B 
 
this also affect tbl_properties_export.php. 
 
i just have no idea wether its a bug or a feature ;)

        <title>(in 2.5.3) Creation/updation date removal. - ID: 768012</title>
        <detail>Hello phpMyAdmin developers. 
 
I have been using phpMyAdmin for 2 years now. And I 
have enjoyed using it. 
 
Recently when I upgraded to 2.5.1, I noticed you guys 
added a nice feature which lists the 
creation/updation/check date for each table. I also 
noticed you put this feature information in the SQL dumps. 
 
When I sync two databases, I usually do a compare on 
two SQL dump files convieniently generated by 
phpMyAdmin. The creation/updation/check date/time 
inclusion ruins the comparision for me. 
 
May I ask that you provide a way to turn off this 
feature? (maybe a config file option, maybe a checkbox 
on the dump page). 
 
Thank you so much!</detail>

The page will be too large when you have a lot of  
databases and table. 
 
Maybe a config option: 
 
$slipt_databases = TRUE; 
 
Will split the frame by Letter with the option to  
show all databases. 
 
If you click on Letter &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; will show: 
 
+ barkel 
+ bakelr 
+ bakrk 
 
If you click on Link &amp;quot;ALL&amp;quot; will show:

        <title>Not allowing reserved words for tables - ID: 531461</title>
        <detail>It might happen to an user to try to use a mysql  
reserved word as a table name, thus thereafter having  
problems adding records to the table.  
 
It would be a nice improvement to verify if the table  
name added by the user for new table creation is not  
among the reserved words, thus preventing this kind of  
mistake.  
 
I'm available for further details,

        <title>(ok 3.2.0) add utility for &quot;errno: 150&quot; on innodb - ID: 1913541</title>
        <detail>i always use InnoDb engine, so from time to time creates sqls shows the fatal &quot;errno: 150&quot; wich does not help too much. 
 
reading comments on mysql official site: 
 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-foreign-key-constraints.html 
 
you will see that &quot;SHOW INNODB STATUS&quot; shows too much information, between them it also show information about the last InnoDb Error, wich is really shows more information about the error.  this really helps. 
 
on the other hand, you already have this link inside phpmyadmin.  so why don't put some link to &quot;SHOW INNODB STATUS&quot; just after the error message IF the error is number 150? 
 
this way will helps users to realice what the hell is going on with the refused innodb sql right away. 
 
thanks.</detail>

        <title>Generate a set of PHP pages for browse/insert/upd/del datas - ID: 733828</title>
        <detail>Hi! 
maybe the title is not really clear... 
 
I enjoy using PhpMyAdmin ! 
but I wan't to be able to write select/insert/update forms  
like in the phpMyAdmin 
A really good feature would be : 
&amp;quot;Generate a set of PHP pages for browsing, inserting,  
updating or deleting data&amp;quot; 
 
Here is a little example with a simple table (id, name,  
email) 
and this script will generate the following pages : 
connect.php : 
- mysql_connect(...) 
 
index.php : 
- include('connect.php'); 
- a form for selecting data 
e.g. : 
&amp;lt;form action=&amp;quot;select.php&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 
Name : &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;...&amp;gt; 
Email : &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;...&amp;gt; 
//Writes input type=text / select / checkboxes... for 
//search options 
&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;Search&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt; 
 
and the select.php 
- perform the search 
- print a table (like in phpmyadmin) 
 
update.php / insert.php 
- like in phpmyadmin, a form with input text /  
checkboxes / select. Not necessarily the &amp;quot;function&amp;quot;  
column ! just the name of the column and the correct  
input type. Don't want any auto_increment 
- a script which perform the update/insert, checking not  
null, unique, primary.... 
 
This set of page will perform the basic tasks for a lot of  
script (a simple guestbook, a dictionnary...) and the  
user (me in that case :-D) will customize form... 
but all the hard an repetitive (for each script!) task will be  
automatically generated. 
 
I know that's may be difficult to do... if only I had time to  
participate to the project... but I don't have :( 
 
Have a good day

        <title>Only table names in scratchboard - ID: 1115420</title>
        <detail>I would like to have an option 'include field names' 
that can be set on or off, affecting the scratchboard. 
If it is set, the behaviour is the same as the current 
behaviour. If it is not set, only the table names are 
showing in the scratchboard (and no field names). 
 
This makes it easier for complex databases to be 
properly layed out. Now I find that a long table is 
being displayed over another table that is positioned 
below it (at a higer Y-value) in the scratchboard 
preview, the PDF output is correct, there is no 
overlap/hiding of tables. 
 
If someone could point me in the right direction (the 
generation of the draggable tables in the 
javascript-scratchboard) then maybe I can make a patch 
myself en post it here for possible inclusion in the 
next release.</detail>

        <title>Parameters in strings - ID: 460251</title>
        <detail>I'm currently translating phpMyAdmin into Finnish.  
However, as the word order in a sentence in  
Finnish is not always the same as in English, it  
makes it difficult to correctly translate strings that  
have been separated into multiple variables in  
language file. 
 
For example, in tbl_properties.php we have &amp;lt;?php  
echo $strFields . ' '. $strEscapedBy; ?&amp;gt;. Using  
English language file this becomes &amp;quot;Fields  
escaped by&amp;quot;. 
 
Because of &amp;quot;limitations&amp;quot; of the Finnish language, I  
can't translate this as it is. Instead, I'm using the  
phrase &amp;quot;Use escape character&amp;quot; for $strEscapedBy.  
In Finnish it is rendered something like &amp;quot;Fields  
Use escape character&amp;quot;. There are also some other  
examples, although not as severe. 
 
Some strings expect that a dynamic value (such as  
database name) follows the string. However, it  
would be more proper in Finnish to use that  
dynamic value in the middle of the sentence. To  
give you an example, something similar could be  
&amp;quot;User JohnDoe has a new password&amp;quot; instead of   
&amp;quot;New password assigned for user JohnDoe&amp;quot;.  
Some strings use %s to include dynamic value in  
the middle of the string. This should be done in  
every string.</detail>

        <title>Re: Bookmarks - ID: 422425</title>
        <detail>Hi 
 
I have just setup the lastest CVS files and tested out  
the new bookmark feature (cool), I just have one  
suggestion: 
 
When you select the bookmark can the bookmarked sql  
string automatically appear in the &amp;quot;Run Sql Query&amp;quot;  
text box. I run many queries that are identical apart  
from one parameter. It would be nice if the bookmarked  
query would appear and then I could just edit it a  
little each time I wanted to run it. 
 
eg... 
 
If I bookmarked a query such as: 
 
select * from users where user = 'pete' 
 
Then next time I wanted to bring up a users  
information I could just change pete to another name  
etc... 
 
Have fun

        <title>export users associated with a specific schema/database - ID: 2949697</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
it would be very convenient if there was the ability when exporting a schema/database users and their privileges associated with it to also be exported in the output .sql file. It would be very helpful because every time restoring a database in a different instance requires manual creation of all users and their privileges in the new instance. It will save us a lot of time especially when moving many databases with many different users attached on them. 
 
thank you very much.</detail>

The diff output below (I'll add a patch shortly) provides a way to stream .zip files direct to stdout (it should probably be changed to use an arbitrary stream).  These changes also contain a fix for a bug in the file timestamps (dechex() does not produce the necessary 8-character strings for older timestamps). 
 
All that is needed to use this option is to add a call to -&gt;setDoWrite() immediately after the instantiation of the zipfile class e.g. 
 
require zip.lib.php 
[...] 
  $zf = new zipfile; 
  $zf-&gt;setDoWrite(); 
  for ( $filnames as $fn) { $zf-&gt;addFile( file_get_contents($fn), basename($fn)); } 
  echo $zf-&gt;file();   // -&gt;file() returns empty string after -&gt;setDoWrite() 
 
 
Diff output follows; modified zip.lib.php, called zipstream.lib.php, is attached.

        <detail>i think that a default config line like this would be 
more useful: 
$cfgPmaAbsoluteUri =

i use phpmyadmin through ssh tunnels (and i'd guess 
other people might do similar things).  i also share a 
copy of phpmyadmin among multiple servers.  i don't 
know if the variable i used is the best one, but it 
seems to work on the multiple versions of php i have to 
deal with.</detail>

        <title>(ok 3.5) Add slow query log with EXPLAIN links - ID: 789883</title>
        <detail>MySQL can be enabled to log slow queries.  If slow 
query logging is on phpMyAdmin could list the slow 
queries and provide links to run EXPLAIN on them.  This 
would allow admins to anaylize the slow queries and 
look for possible ways to prevent them in the future. 
 
Currently this is something that can be done manully by 
inspecting the log file and copy/pasting the SQL into a 
mysql prompt or into phpMyAdmin.  Adding this direct 
ability to check slow queries from the web would be a 
nice fetaure.</detail>

You all know how it is .. you want to click show .. but u click &quot;remove&quot; coz you didnt aim too well ...  
 
Yes I know there is a security question before removing the table ... but  I would rate it 30-50% that people dont actually read every Question Popup .. or they are a bit distracted and click on it before understand that it really meant. 
 
maybe the &quot;remove Table&quot; Option should be under Operations by default !?</detail>

        <title>DB design hint: too much TEXT columns - ID: 3025070</title>
        <detail>Problem: 
In case of too many TEXT/BLOB columns in a table, a data insert could end up on error 139. 
The number of  columns could be as low as 10! *) 
http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=1611 
http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=10035 
 
Conditions: any version of MySQL (mine is 5.1.30) 
limit depends on storage engine (InnoDB is affected more) 
 
Proposal: 
PMA will issue a warning on table page about this little known restriction. User is aware and could do prevent it in early stage of db design, or before production use hits that. 
 
*) for InnoDB. 768 chars is used one utf8 TEXT field - that means 7680 chars for 10 such fields - add few other fields and you hit the limit 8000 chars (half of database page). Ten TEXT fields are ok in circumstances when some of the values are NULL or we don't use utf8 (then limit raises to cca 15 fields).  
for MyISAM is similar limit higher, at cca 85 fields. http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=21101#c80978 
 
Such behavior of PMA would be a lifesaver for most people that don't know that such limit exists and later could save them database redesign need.</detail>

this is usefull when you're working on and switching

the function or use of every table. or just had a few  
days of and have to dive into the structure again. 
 
dunno if possible but adding field comments would be  
nice too. that's probably not possible in mysql, but  
maybe as an add-on in phpmyadmin... 
 
is there a common way or api for 'expanding'  
phpmyadmin with custom-built scripts and utils? 
 
lbnl a 'favorites' mechanism for storing sql queries,  
including comments. just a few ideas.

        <detail>Hi, 
 
I think it would be nice (if possible) to move the shell scripts (*.sh) files from the &quot;lang&quot; folder to another or a sub folder. That would make it much easier for everybody to delete the unneeded languages before transferring the program to your server. I usually just need two languages and therefor can save about 6MB by removing the unneeded languages before uploading the files to my server. But while deleting the unwanted php files I have to watch out, not to delete one of the .sh files. So if they could be moved into another folder it I could jsut select all files and deselect the language files I need on my server and delete all other remaining files. 
 
Kind regards

        <detail>Another idea just struck me.  Well, this has always  
happened to me and I thought that others may like it.   
When you are creating a new database table, and you  
already are in the page with the rows to set names and  
properties to, I normally end up by over counting (as in I  
don't need it) or I miscounted one as I just realized that  
I forgot.  On that page where you set the properties to  
your new table, there should be an option somewhere  
near the bottom where you can add or remove rows in

        <title>Name foreign key constraints - ID: 3432781</title>
        <detail>MySQL allows to give an explicit name to foreign key constraints. 
It would be fine if phpMyAdmin could add a field in the &quot;Relation view&quot; to view and edit this FK name. 
 
For example the following statement: ALTER TABLE X ADD FOREIGN KEY (fk) REFERENCES Y (id); 
Automatically assigns this name: x_ibfk_1 
 
These automated names are assigned with an auto-incrementing number, which is not predictable if we don't know in which order the foreign keys have been defined. When we have to create SQL patches to be ran on a database, there is most often no way to know the foreign key name reliably if someone created it with phpMyAdmin!</detail>

This will avoid to use a link from /etc/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php to /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php

        <title>Ideas for no-frame version - ID: 2300692</title>
        <detail>From an anonymous contributor: 
------- 
What I'd really like to see in a future release is scrapping the frames system. 
 
There are very simple and well-supported ways these days of keeping a static and scrollable left menu without using frames, namely using position: fixed and overflow: auto on a CSS div. I can't keep count of the number of times I've pressed refresh on the browser to reload a page and the whole frameset has reloaded from scratch! 
----- 
Do you know of a way to refresh the left menu in case a user deletes a table or creates a table from the main section? 
----- 
Ah, good point. 
 
I think there are three possible solutions here. 
 
1) The first suggestion is probably the most 'correct' but probably the  
hardest to get to given the current code base. Replace calls of echoing  
HTML by building it up in an $html array, then at the end, compile your  
menu as $menuHtml. Finally at the end of the page do echo $menuHtml .  
$html . (In general, I personally find that $html -building leads to more  
flexible coding in the long run than using echo directly.) 
 
2) Presumably you could use the PHP output buffering stuff to stop the  
output being displayed to screen. Then call $html = ob_get_clean(). Then  
do as per (1) above - compile $menuHtml and then echo $menuHtml . $html . 
 
3) Probably the simplest but arguably not ideal in terms of placement in  
the HTML order - but still probably better than a frameset. Simply compile  
and echo the menu at the end of the page, but use CSS fixed positioning to  
place it on the left-hand side of the page. 
 
4) An iframe could also be considered, but I have to say that really feels  
nasty, and would probably require javascript to refresh.</detail>

        <title>NEW EXPORT IDEA (huge describition) ! - ID: 632237</title>
        <detail>Ill explain how the phpMyAdmin can improve the import  
end export. Mostly for huge (!!) *.sql files. Ill post it in  
some PMA forums because I dont know where is  the  
right place to post it the developer ppl. 
 
Some projects have so much data, also on private sites  
that it seems to be impossible to export all the data in  
one step, so you have to separate your tables in equal  
packages. But this is pain in the ass. And mostly the  
DB tables are very various in size and length of the rows  
count. For example a nation table contains around 250  
data rows and a user table has 10.000 rows with an  
approx *.sql text file size of 3 MB (unpacked). Well and  
thats are, for my example, only two tables from 30 all in  
all. 
 
Ok, how can the phpMyAdmin solve this common  
problem. 
 
My first idea is phpMyAdmin should also have the  
possibility to import gzip packed *.sql files. I dont know  
how the gzip export works (I hope PMA take a look into  
the server config files or so and if PMA find gzip he  
enable the function in the export dialog). Well if that is  
correct why he does not support (g)zip packed *.sql files  
as well? It should be very simple to add that function  
that the import file which extract the *.sql file into  
the /tmp folder at the server and import that file like PMA  
does it mostly well like the normal way of uploading a  
file. Ok, that feature should drastically decrease the  
time of a sql upload because *.sql files are text files  
which have mostly a compress rate by 50  90 percent. 
 
Ok, how about a new idea which requires the upload  
directory support. Well if you have the mysql DB as I  
explained in the example above PMA should use  
another tactic to have a successful export and import  
without errors and timeouts. Thats what I want to figure  
out now. 
 
My idea is based on the good old rar/zip compressor  
which can handle multiply archive files. Well how about  
to modify that idea to work with PMA as well. 
 
What the PMA ppl have to do is that: 
 
You should add a pull down menu were you can select  
a stepsize from 500 up to 5000 query steps. For  
example I select the 3000 Step and press export. My  
example DB has approx after an one-file export and *.sql  
file with 30 querys which creates my tables and 60.000  
INSERT querys. All in all nearly 60.000 Querys. 60.000 /  
3000 = 20 steps. So what means steps. The export  
process have to count all written Querys. (a function  
should count all tables and rows before the _new_  
export starts. So the export file knows that a separated  
export with the given steps is what the user want.) Ok, a  
function tells another function that we now knew that a  
separated export is required, so be it. The export now  
counts all querys and take a break after the 3000s  
query, close the file and create a new one, which starts  
from 3001 until 6000.  And so on until the last data is  
written to the *.sql file. 
 
The file names should be like this: 
 
Webshop.part001.sql 
Webshop.part002.sql 
Webshop.part003.sql 
 
Or like this 
 
Webshop.part001.020.sql 
Webshop.part002.020.sql 
Webshop.part003.020.sql 
 
Which tells the import process how many files are a part  
of the whole import but its not necessary to have that  
syntax. 
 
Well after the export is finished we have now 30 files  
where each file contains 3000 querys and its useless to  
know if it is a CREATE or and INSERT or and UPDATE  
or what ever  query is query, thats all what has to  
count here. (the last file counts only the rest of the  
whole export may be lesser that 3000). 
 
Ok, the download problem later. 
 
The big advance to separate the whole export in defined  
query steps is that the files are very little and the import  
will have no timeout or error (I hope that). To separate  
the parts by tables is useless because one table has 30  
rows and one other 20.000 as I explained before. 
 
So, the import should be easy. You have to upload all  
your files into the upload dir and tell the import dialog  
the first file which contains part001.sql. The import  
function should take care of the rest. The end of the  
import is when no part00? File is anymore into the  
import dir. Well we should add a function which counts  
all files and break when a part0XX file is lost. That  
should be useful to prevent errors. For example INSERT  
querys in a table which is not already created. 
 
Ok, if the gzip import is made or allowed it would be  
great to have a gzip file which can be uploaded and you  
can also have *.part0XX.sql in it.  
 
This idea is useless when the import process imports all  
part0XX.sql files in one step. I mean with ONE page call.  
If so we have the same old problem with timeout on  
huge *.sql imports. So here is my idea: All what you  
need is a session and/or and popup which takes care of  
the separated import. 
 
When a PMA check tells another function that the  
import (its equal if from the gzip, the upload dir or may  
be from the normal upload) has parts PMA should open  
an popup which has the same functions like the normal  
import script but additionally the ability to recall itself (!!!)  
were a parameter tells the popup which is the next file  
and how many querys are already imported (mostly for  
the final result in the normal window).  
 
For example, when PMA has my 20 parts *.sql import  
PMA open an Popup which tell the user Attention that  
is an Import which has some steps, please be patient  
until the process is finished (you can add here a number  
like part 1 / 20 or a faked process bar with 20 steps or  
something else)). The popup will close itself at the end  
of the whole import, so take a cup of coffee of do  
something else until the import is finished. The popup  
should close itself at the end and call the normal window  
which contains the PMA result page. 
 
Well thats all. You can use the session to save the  
informations for the next import call or the get method  
which Ill prefer here to be compatible with php3. 
 
Here is idea how to create the multiply send dialog or  
function when send is chosen but also STEPs 3000 is  
selected. After creating the part0XX files in the /tmp dir a  
list with for my example 20 links should be created so  
that the user can download all the files. Well I dont  
know the way to create multiply downloads. If someone  
has an idea feel free to add this to my idea. 
 
I knew that some serious problems can be here, but well  
simply add a profi cfg variable which enable that.  
Beginners can damage to much with that stuff described  
here. But I hope someone who is more involved like me  
into the phpMyAdmin project takes a closer look at my  
idea. 
 
Btw. This separated export/import is useless  
when send is not checked. So when someone check  
the steps and does not checkd the send checkbox it  
simply should ignored.</detail>

        <title>Preserve timestamp field with ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - ID: 1708304</title>
        <detail>http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1723419&amp;forum_id=72909 describes this, but I'll copy that information here: 
 
========================= 
This is for phpmyadmin 2.10.0.2.  
 
I have a timestamp field, set for the NOW() function, in a database record. I manually update the records in this database, and the intent of the field is for, most times anyway, the timestamp field to log the last time a record was updated.  
 
However, on some occasions when I update a field, I DON'T want the timestamp data in the record to change; I want it to remain whatever it had been.  
 
I'd think that if I just used the pulldown menu under FUNCTION to change NOW to the blank entry, the timestamp would remain the same. But it doesn't. It updates to the current date/time. But if I copy the previous date/time, paste it back into the timestamp field after the field has been unwantedly updated, again change FUNCTION from NOW to blank, and save, I am able to reset the timestamp field back to what it was.  
 
This is crazy. All I want is a way, using phpmyadmin, to, if I choose to, update some fields in a record, but keep the timestamped field holding the last value it had and not updating.  
 
What am I doing wrong?  
========================= 
 
Below is the structure of the table I am talking about.  It's the Last_Update field that I'd like to sometimes keep static when updating other fields. 
 
LastName  	varchar(25)  	latin1_swedish_ci  	  	Yes  	NULL  	 	  Browse distinct values   	  Change   	  Drop   	  Primary   	  Unique   	  Index   	  Fulltext

        <title>Preview SQL instead of executing it. - ID: 2521245</title>
        <detail>I use PMA to &quot;write&quot; a lot of queries for me, and by that I mean i will use PMA to build a table, then copy the SQL to another insall of PMA on a production server, and execute it there. 
 
Other times I might want to change a column type, or change a column's collation / keys or something of the like which might take several minutes [I have large tables] and the page times out. 
 
Usually PMA will display the SQL it executed afterwards, except on very long queries and pages which time out, so: 
 
I'd love to have a checkbox that says, &quot;Preview SQL&quot; before PMA executes the query. This would only apply to queries which PMA helps automate for us [like building tables, index tweaks, column changes]. 
 
Sometimes I don't want to _run_ the SQL, just have PMA spit it out for me so I can batch it at a later time :-)</detail>

When he does a database copy he would like the ability

I'm going to post what he has sent to me. 
 
// Begin Email

1. Select a database  
2. Operations  
3. Copy database to...  
 
When copying a single table you get the option to add

        <title>Export SQL file extension: as .mysql, not .sql - ID: 1504377</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
At the moment phpMyAdmin extensively supports mysql. 
When a user exports their database through phpmyadmin, 
the exported file (locahost.sql) ends in a .sql 
extension. Furthermore, the mysql engine proceses 
imported and exported files and files are generated to 
comply with addtional mysql sql grammer rules (beyond 
the original sql grammer specs). 
 
Recommendation: 
The localhost.sql file be renamed to localhost.mysql, 
or localhost.mysql.sql (to imply that it confirms to 
sql, but needs to maintain mysql syntax rules which at 
the same time do conflict with sql conventions... see 
example below) 
 
Reasoning: 
If you are editing the sql file in a text editor, you 
must comply with mysql grammer specs if you want the 
file to be compatable with other phpmyadmin mysql 
installations.  
 
To anyone reviewing the file localhost.sql in their 
favourite text editor (vim, emacs, whatever), it would 
more benefiticial to have mysql syntax highlighting 
apply to the file rather than sql syntax highlighting. 
Mysql language syntax deviates in at least one area 
from SQL syntax: 
 
 
 
I found this (edited for conciseness) on mysql's 
website (note the part about 'must be followed by a 
space'... if you don't do that, the file won't import 
successfuly back into mysql): 
 
 
Standard SQL uses '--' as a start-comment sequence. 
MySQL Server 3.23.3 and up also supports a variant of 
the '--' comment style. That is, the '--' start-comment 
sequence must be followed by a space (or by a control 
character such as a newline). 
The space is required to prevent problems with 
automatically generated SQL queries that use constructs 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/ansi-diff-comments.html 
 
 
 
Thoughts? This isn't a bug, per-se, but it prevents 
bugs and can encourage more appropriate syntax 
highlighting. I was importing back into phpmyadmin a 
file I exported earlier, and made the mistake above 
with comments. There, I learned that in this case, 
mysql requires an update of sql specs.

        <detail>When using a single database to store both actual data  
as well as the special tables used for relationships and  
so forth, it would be convenient if those tables were  
hidden by default in the list. (Putting them in a separate  
database would make more sense, but I don't have that  
option, since my phpMyAdmin installation is in my own  
directory, not something my provider gives me, and I  
don't have sufficient access to create and set up the  
separate database)

For config, you normally have to edit config.inc.php

Either make the tabs live (which is impossible without

        <title>edit/delete links on joined tables - ID: 668999</title>
        <detail>Hi! 
 
When working with my user database, I usually join  
more than one table to get an overview of all of each  
user's information. Sometimes when a user registers,  
he misspells his e-mail-address, so I have to manually  
change it and send him his code. 
 
What I'm missing, is the edit links, when browsing the  
complete joined tables. Would it be possible to fetch all  
primary keys from the joined tables and place edit links  
for all entries in the row, just like when browsing one  
table. 
 
e.g. 
 
edit tab1 | tab1field1 | tab1field2 | tab2field1 | tab2field2 
edit tab2 
 
And while you're at it, could you also add a delete  
function, in which all rows in the different tables would  
be deleted all at once? 
 
Thanks and keep up the great work...

        <title>(in 2.6.0) Refresh browse, refresh processes - ID: 942110</title>
        <detail>Two feature requests in one ... a &quot;Refresh&quot; link for 
viewing processes would be nice. 
 
Plus, a &quot;refresh&quot; link would be cool too, when 
browsing, executing a query, or whatever.  Just having 
it next to &quot;Export&quot; at the bottom of the page would be 
a big help.  Often when running a query, I'll see what 
results come up, modify something, delete a row or 
whatever somewhere else, and want to run that same 
query with that same page # returned (last page, for 
example).  Adding some kind of refresh option would 
help al ot. 
 
thanks guys</detail>

        <title>(ok 3.5) Drop down for 'Jump to Recent table' list - ID: 2098927</title>
        <detail>Have a drop down that appears just under the top tabs Browser | Structure | SQl | ETC 
 
This drop down shows a list of the 10 most recent tables you have viewed 
 
If you have a load of tables, in multiple databases, jumping back and forth between them can be a little slow. 
 
The preferences should allow you to set: 
 
1) Show last x -&gt; you should be able to choose how many table to list in the drop down from 1 to 20 maybe 
 
2) Only show tables in current DB or show tables across all your DBs 
 
3) Jump to 'Browse view ' or Jump to 'Structure view' when selecting a table. 
 
 
My preferences would be 
1) show last 10 tables 
2) show tables across all databases 
3) jump to structure view 
 
Maybe even have a radio select to hit for browse view or structure view which you can select before selecting     the table. 
 
 
This would be really really helpful. 
Keep up the great work

        <title>Auto increment values reorganising - ID: 954842</title>
        <detail>This is just a small suggestion but would be very  
valueable to keeping a database organized, neat, and  
possibly for large databases reducing the size. My idea is  
if you have a primary key that just does 1, 2, 3, 4, with  
the auto inc feature that there would be a link to  
reorganize them. Sometimes you have to delete them, or  
just when testing you skip around so its 1, 2, 45, 48, 49,  
51 what about something that reorgainizes them into 1,  
2, 3, 4, 5. It would be somewhat simple to code and you  
could always put a big warning at the top about what  
this does and to make sure your using it on the right  
field. In my opinion this would be an extreamly useful  
feature. 
 
Thanks

        <title>(ok 4.0) Let group tables/views into &quot;folders&quot; - ID: 2995138</title>
        <detail>Very often there's a large number of tables inside one database. 
F.e., 20-30 tables may control site forum, ~ 10 tables may refer to search engine, etc. 
Moving logical groups of tables into separate databases is often bad solution, 'cos: 1) complicates app portability, 2) many host providers limit DB number. 
 
Sometimes there's table groups based on app logic. 
F.e., some tables may contain &quot;abstract&quot; data, that must be accessible for daily customers only for reading. 
During operations like GRANT privileges, Export &amp; Import selecting those groups manually over &amp; over again is inconvenient &amp; error-prone. 
 
The suggestion is to support &quot;packing&quot; similar tables into new PMA object, &quot;folder&quot; or &quot;directory&quot;, stored on pma_db level. 
A folder can contain tables/views &amp; other folders. 
 
When folder is &quot;pma current object&quot;: 
 
  1. Its name appears in top div &quot;serverinfo&quot;. 
     This div now displays [server name] &gt; [db_name] &gt; [folder(s) path] &gt; [current object's name]. 
 
  2. Only folders/tables/views directly nested in it are visible on &quot;Structure&quot; tab. 
 
Selecting (checking on) folder on &quot;Structure&quot; tab for group operation means: do that operation for all its (direct &amp; indirect) child objects. 
For organizing existing databases, support moving tables between folders. 
phpMyAdmin is 1-panel manager, so move interface may be:  
1) check tables to move, on &quot;Structure&quot; tab,  
2) Select in &quot;submit_mult&quot; element new option, &quot;Move to folder&quot;, 
3) When it's selected, display new  element filled with names of existing folders. 
 
Maybe, the term &quot;folder&quot; should be replaced by &quot;directory&quot; or &quot;table group&quot;.</detail>

        <title>Auto File Module (AFM) - ID: 720990</title>
        <detail>I will try to explain this new feature, then give an  
example of its use. 
 
@Feature; Automatically handle and download a file. 
Insert;  PMA would allow the client to browse for a local  
file.  On submit, it would check the file (needs settings  
from afm_settings table).  Then, download the file,  
saving it as the new name.  Insert the new name into  
the DB cell for that record submitted by client. 
 
Delete;  Check if there is a field match in afm_settings.  
If so, Deletes file, and proceeds to normal deleting of  
record.  
 
Update;  Check if there is a difference in file names.  If  
so proceed to 'insert' new file and details. 
 
 
@USE, example; Human profiles. Name,  
Photo_file_name fields. Type a string for the Name, and  
have a Browse button for Photo_file_name.   
 
Storing a humans Name and Photo picture is not only  
text, so this process would have to be done with a  
custom made page.  With this mod, custom made  
pages (of this type) would no longer be necessary. 
 
This mod would help save alot of clients time and  
errors.  Especially lazy server file management. 
 
I would like to help code this mod.

number the column I need next has. As it is I have to

        <title>(Relation) combobox when inserting/editing - ID: 591090</title>
        <detail>If we use the PMA_relation Table this should also  
cause to show a Combobox with the releated  
Records from a releated Table in Add/Change  
Record Page. 
This could may be done by adding a field to the  
PMA_relation Table (master_cb_show_field), which  
will be shown as Combobox in all Add/Change  
Pages for the field if referred. 
 
For instance: 
 
Table 1: ArticleGroups 
Field 1 : GroupNo 
Field 2 : GroupName 
 
Records: 
1;MyFirstArticle 
2;MySecondArticle 
3;MyThirdArticle 
 
Table 2: Articles 
Field 1: ArticleNo 
Field 2: GroupNo 
Field 3: ArticleName 
 
Records: 
1;1;CoolThing 
2;1;PrettyCoolThing 
3;2;UnCoolThing 
4;3;UglyThing 
 
Table: PMA_relation 
Field 1: master_db  
Field 2: master_table 
Field 3: master_field 
Field 4: master_cb_show_field 
Field 5: oreign_db  
Field 6: foreign_table  
Field 7: foreign_field  
 
Record: 
MyMasterDB;ArticleGroups;No;GroupName;MyMaster 
DB;Articles;ArticleNo 
 
=&amp;gt; GroupName in PMA_relation will cause that in  
Add/Change Record of Articles a Combobox with  
this: 
MyFirstArticle 
MySecondArticle 
MyThirdArticle 
 
will be shown as field for GroupNo. The GroupNo  
(1,2,3) should be stored instead of the Name of  
course. 
 
The reason for this Idea corresponds to MS-ACCESS.  
Entering a new record in a releated Table you need  
a more speaking sollution to find the right Number  
for the joined field.

        <title>(in 2.6.4) Show column comments while editing - ID: 860912</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
Like we all know MySQL supports column comments from 
the version 4.1.0. Would it be possible to show these 
comments in &amp;quot;Insert&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Edit&amp;quot; views if they are 
available. Now I see only &amp;quot;Field&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Type&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Null&amp;quot; and 
&amp;quot;Value&amp;quot; columns in these views. It would be very 
informative to save good field descriptions in MySQL 
tables and show them to user when he/she edit table data.

        <title>Add one option to disable SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS - ID: 1452330</title>
        <detail>phpMyAdmin team, 
 
When i have one big select, when this select use more 
then one table, mysql create a temporary table to 
result.  To count, phpMyAdmin use SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS. 
With that +50% of query time are to count this result. 
My idea is create one config to disable 
SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS.

        <title>Please add a comment to the databases - ID: 1124859</title>
        <detail>I am using this great tool at my internet-server. The 
problem is, that all databases are created by the 
internet-provider. This means, the names of the 
databases are db123456, db123457, db3245675 and so on 
(only a autoincrement number). Because this is the 
server of an internet-provider and not my own, i can't 
change the names. So on the dropdown-List of the 
phpmyadmin database selection i fount the names

        <title>Create indexes at the end in SQL export - ID: 1660474</title>
        <detail>It will be nice to make an optimized export , so when i'll export a database the indexes of the tables to be created to the bottom of the file (after the tables creations and data inserts/update/replace). In this way when i import the database the time spent will be much smaller. 
I saw that a solution for myisam tables is to disable keys and after inserts to enable keys, but for innodb tables i did't find other solutions. 
 
sorry for my poor english. 
 
the export file structure:  
 
1. create tables without indexes 
2. insert data 
3. create indexes 
 
 
ps. i spent 4h to import a 30Mb sql file on windows...:((;

        <title>drop table violates constraints - ID: 2123307</title>
        <detail>Sometimes, attempting to drop a table will fail, because the table has effective constraints - you then have to manually empty the table, and then drop it. 
 
This is particularly annoying when you're trying to drop a large number of tables, and have to go back many times and manually empty each failing table... 
 
I suggest checking for constraints, and if constraints are in effect for a table being dropped, do a truncate first (as emptying out the table will not cause constraint violations), and then drop the table.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.6.0) CSS styling of PMA tabs - ID: 946540</title>
        <detail>Hi. Since PMA 2.6.0-alpha1 and later now offer 
config.header.inc and config.footer.inc I have been 
trying to give PMA an interface makeover using CSS. 
And I've noticed a few areas where PMA makes this 
difficult. 
 
It would be easier to style the tabs at the top of 
many PMA pages, for example, if the various tab 
states were given useful CSS classes. Currently 
all tabs seem to always have the CSS class set to 
&quot;tab nowrap&quot;. It would be helpful if disabled tabs 
were identifiable with a CSS class, for example 
&quot;tab_disabled nowrap&quot; or &quot;tab disabled nowrap&quot;. 
The currently-selected tab would also be a good 
candidate for a CSS class: &quot;tab_hilited nowrap&quot; 
or &quot;tab hilited nowrap&quot;. And finally, it would be 
helpful if the &quot;dangerous&quot; tabs Empty and Drop 
would have their own class: &quot;tab_drop nowrap&quot; or 
&quot;tab drop nowrap&quot; -- this would make it possible 
to style the entire tab itself, rather than only the 
link inside it, as is currently the only possibility. 
 
These changes would be appreciated as they would 
help simplify the task of restyling PMA.</detail>

        <detail>I don't know if it's possible but I'd like a setting where you could specify a default sort order when browsing a table.  This could either apply globally and use whatever the Primary Key is (if there is one) or possibly an individual setting for each table (though that sounds like more work). 
 
This would be very useful for my development and testing as when I'm adding records and I want to check they have inserted correctly I usually want to go the the end of the table straight away.  As it stands I have to click on the column name twice to sort in descending order.</detail>

        <title>Table interface improvements - ID: 2485554</title>
        <detail>I was creating a website with 2/3 projects init. 
After finishing this my database was full with lots of tables. 
And i was thinking is it possible to create something like a tree menu in the tables because its easier to find everything when your database is full with tables and you dont have the premission to create more then 1 database. 
 
example: 
 
* = Folder 
- = table in the folder (until next *) 
() = possible a automatic insert when you create a table 
 
*Projectname1 
  - (Projectname1_)table1 
  - (Projectname1_)table2 
  - (Projectname1_)table3 
 
*Projectname2 
  - (Projectname2_)table1 
  - (Projectname2_)table2 
  - (Projectname2_)table3 
  - (Projectname2_)table4 
  - (Projectname2_)table5 
 
*Projectname3 
  - (Projectname3_)table1 
  - (Projectname3_)table2 
  - (Projectname3_)table3

        <title>export with field transformations - ID: 1247469</title>
        <detail>I love the current export functionality - works perfect  
every time (for me at least)..  what would be really  
helpful in the end would be an export feature that would  
allow you to transform/translate the field names &amp; table  
names in the exported information... 
 
For example: I'm migrating data from one database into  
another, but the field names are different and the table  
names are different. 
 
So I could check an option like &quot;translate data output&quot;  
and then a DHTML frame would display showing the  
current field &amp; table names with a handy ---&gt; and then a  
text box.. 
 
e.g. 
 
[] Translate Column or Table Names: 
 
[]   Old Table 1 Name ---&gt;  [___________] 
- Old Column 1 Name ---&gt;  [___________] 
- Old Column 2 Name ---&gt;  [___________] 
 
[]   Old Table 2 Name ---&gt;  [___________] 
- Old Column 1 Name ---&gt;  [___________] 
- Old Column 2 Name ---&gt;  [___________] 
 
where the checkbox in front of a table name could be  
used to indicate if that is included in the transformation  
(could be optional vs. having to check for input all the  
way). 
 
This would greatly enhance the handiness of  
phpmyadmin and just be plain ole cool.

        <detail>It will be very helpful if you add visual editor of 
extended foreign keys statements like ON DELETE 
CASCADE, ON UPDATE SET NULL etc for Inno DB tables. 
 
Now it is enough hard work to change foreign keys with 
these statements because these definitions aren't 
displayed in the references and can be viewed only with 
SHOW CREATE TABLE query. Also one way to change them is 
removing of foreign key (via ALTER TABLE DROP FOREIGN 
KEY query) and creating of new foreign key manually 
(via ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY query). 
 
Because MySQL stands on the way to become reliable DB 
server with support of data integrity checking, I think 
you need to add such functions in nearest releases.</detail>

        <detail>Hi, 
I am running processes which usually last over 1300 seconds.  Yet I do not have a visual indicator that tells me if the machine is happily processing or if it simply has choked. 
Would it be possible to have a progress bar or a task bar or at least a color indicator to show me that the process is still continuing? 
For example: 
Creating index OK, next check: 60 sec. 
Running query OK, next check: 30 sec. 
This would also be great for large uploads: 
Uploading: 450 MB OK, next check: 60 sec. 
All the very best,

        <title>(ok 3.4) signon auth method too limited - ID: 2936155</title>
        <detail>The signon auth_type allows user to pass login/password/hostname only. While if mysql site has grant for user with &quot;REQUIRE SSL&quot; then you also need to pass ssl flag (just like $cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl']  in config). 
 
Unfortunately signon auth API is quite limited and doesn't allow to do that. 
 
Suggested fix: 
 
Change signon API to allow to pass ANY $cfg flag in some way. That would allow for external signon script to fill all required configuration data that mysqladmin would later use. 
 
Same applies to choosen language interface. Right now there is no sane way to specify language via signon API.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.5.6) Improve browsing foreign windows - ID: 868369</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
I am using phpMySQL 2.5.5 on debian linux (3.0 r2), php 
4.1.2, MySQL 4.0.16. Here is some bugs I discovered 
when I tried to get to know foreign key functionality 
in phpMyAdmin.  
 
A) 
In &quot;insert&quot; view it is difficult to find proper foreign 
field value using &quot;foreing browser&quot; because available 
foreign values are not sorted. I made a small 
modifiacation to get_foreigners.lib.php file to correct 
the sorting problem: 
 
37c37 
&lt;  . (($foreign_display == FALSE) ? '' :' ORDER BY ' . 
PMA_backquote($foreign_table) . '.' . 
PMA_backquote($foreign_display)) 
--- 
&gt;   . ' ORDER BY ' . PMA_backquote($foreign_table) . 
'.' . PMA_backquote($foreign_field) 
 
B) 
I think that &quot;foreign broser&quot; window should be a little 
bit wider. My browser (Mozilla 1.5) shows the scrollbar 
on the bottom of the windows because the content is 
wider than the browser window.  
 
C) 
Paging do not work. I can see first 200(?) foreign 
values on the first page but if I try to choose the 
second page I see the following error message. &quot;Show 
all&quot; button works correctly 
 
Warning: Supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result 
resource in 
/opt/phpMyAdmin255/libraries/mysql_wrappers.lib.php on 
line 36 
 
Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in 
/opt/phpMyAdmin255/libraries/relation.lib.php on line 311 
 
D)  
I do not understand the meaning of the all columns in 
&quot;foreing browser&quot;. Why &quot;Keyname&quot; and &quot;Description&quot; 
columns are displaied twice on table header (&quot;Keyname&quot;, 
 &quot;Description&quot;, &quot;Show all&quot;/Page selector, 
&quot;Description&quot;, &quot;Keyname&quot;) 
 
F) 
If &quot;RepeatCells&quot; in config.inc.php is set to &quot;0&quot; table 
header is repeated after every third row. &quot;0&quot; should 
disable table header from repeating... 
 
 
 
PS: I am using InnoDB foreign keys instead of 
phpMyAdmin relations if it make difference

        <title>Insert value ranges - ID: 858589</title>
        <detail>Hello,  
 
phpMyAdmin is a terrific program. However, I realize that it  
can't cover all cases right away. Here is one opportunity to  
alleviate a big problem with a, hopefully, simple addition.  
 
Would you be so kind to add a multiple insert form where it  
would be possible to set up ranges of data to be inserted and  
the underlying php code would loop over those ranges and do all  
the requested inserts? It's so easy to do in a real language, but  
not in SQL.  
 
For example: I have a table with 18 fields. I need to add a 1000   
records that insert identical values for 4 fields,  and increment  
the primary key. Right now my only options are to use  
phpMyAdmin's &amp;quot;Insert&amp;quot; form to insert each record separately  
(insane in this case) or use python (I don't know php,  
unfortunately) to insert those records using a simple loop. I can  
do that easily. However, other people in my lab can only use  
phpMyAdmin and they really want to be able to do such  
additions from phpMyAdmin.  
 
Thank you very much.

Basically, if I run an SQL query such as 
 
Select field1 from table; 
 
I get a nice list of one field results. however when I now do &quot;Check All&quot; and then &quot;Edit&quot;, it gives me all fields to edit. really, it should know that i only ran a query with one field, so i should only edit one field.

        <detail>Hi, 
 
I have no problem with the decision to default to forbidding root access with no password, however the error message provided is &quot;Access denied&quot; which doesn't help the user at all. It would be most helpful if the error message would at least explain what is happening and how to set a password. 
 
I can't find the logic for this at all; the error appears to be $strAccessDenied but the only references I see to that string relate to the Allow,Deny rules. I'll submit a patch if someone can help point me in the right direction.</detail>

Didn't find in the documentation that this was possible so here I'm filing an feature request, sorry if it IS featured allready. 
 
 
I'm running a server with seperate MySQL services and it works like a charm with your application. 
 
However, when I switch between these servers I choose between &quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;ip:port&quot;, &quot;ip:port&quot; (and so on). Why now make it possible to name these servers to whatever users would like? 
 
Thank you for you time and all your work in this project!

        <title>(ok 4.0) Inline editing by double click - ID: 3522109</title>
        <detail>Currently (pma 3.5.0) grid editing in browse mode is started on click. 
This can be annoying for some users, f.e., they fear important table data can be accidentally damaged. 
Another bad thing is unexpected starting edit mode when trying to select some text in grid (to copy it to clipboard). 
 
It would be good to support 3 configuration modes of Grid editing: 
- On click (current behavior), 
- On double click, 
- Disable. 
 
While there's no this useful setting, I replaced in /js/makegrid.js: 
$(g).find(&quot;td.data&quot;).click

        <title>Add character set env. overview to Charsets tab - ID: 1152937</title>
        <detail>I have two issues, which possibly could lead a bug report. 
 
1)  If I enable cookie authentication type, I am 
presented with the login screen, where I can choose the 
language. There are two types of encoding almost for 
all languages at this screen: UTF-8 and ISO (more for 
Cyrillic, etc). Once I login (I use MySQL 4.1.x), PMA 
switches to UTF-8 encoding for its output and UTF-8 
encodings are the only choice I have (on the title page). 
 
Is this intended? Why the lists of possible encodings 
are different before and after login? 
 
 
2) My MySQL server has the following default settings 
(using SHOW VARIABLES): 
 
character set database: latin1 
character set server: latin1 
 
collation database: latin1_german2_ci 
collation server: latin1_german2_ci 
 
If my `character set server` is latin1, why on the 
title page PMA shows the following info (directly under 
the change language dropdown list)?: 
 
MySQL charset: UTF-8 Unicode (utf8).</detail>

        <title>Do not onfocus=&amp;quot;this.select&amp;quot; for TEXTAREA - ID: 761130</title>
        <detail>Can you please get rid of the scripting that 
automatically selects all the contents in the textarea 
at the SQL-tab, once you focus it? 
I think it's irritating, and it complete ruins the 
usage of X11 copy-and-paste as it overwrites the 
clipboard with the textarea contents. 
And also, if I just want to insert a few characters 
inside existing code, I must sometime click 4 or 5 
times before it works as expected. 
 
At least make this optional somehow through config? Thanks!</detail>

        <title>Suggestions for config.inc.php - ID: 1339406</title>
        <detail>I would have following ideas for the config.inc.php file: 
 
* in 2.7.0-dev, databases which start with the same  
names are grouped together. It would be nice if it could  
be turned off in config.inc.php to get the behavior from the  
versions &lt; 2.6.4 
 
* in 2.7.0-dev, the number of rows in the table detail view  
are given in approximate numbers (e.g. 2 k for 2,000). I  
would also appreciate if it could be set back to the  
behavior in previous versions. 
 
* the section 'MySQL settings' at the bottom seem to  
refer to general MySQL issues, less to personal  
configuration settings. So it might fit better into a  
separate file. 
 
* a separate changelog only for the config.inc.php would  
be nice. If someone updates very frequently (like I do) it's  
much effort to find all the changes between the config. 
inc.php in the former version and the new one. 
 
By the way (it's a little off topic to config.inc.php) - maybe  
another default theme would also be nice - I like the  
Cactica Blues theme much. Maybe it's possible to make  
a poll which theme users would like as a new default :-).</detail>

$cfg['Servers'][$i] array that would let you give a 
short nick name to the server. This would come in handy 
when you had to refer to several servers by only an IP 
address. You could then name one 'Development DB' and 
another 'Production DB' or something similar. These 
nick names should then be displayed in place of the 
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] value as long as the 
nickname wasn't empty.</detail>

        <title>PDF relation query (pdf_schema.php) - ID: 578876</title>
        <detail>I couldn't get past an error when I set up a &amp;quot;relation&amp;quot; 
between two tables and tried to see a PDF graphic of 
the relation.  The sql call to the relation kept 
retrieving 0 records.  Soooo. 
 
I modified the following in pdf_schema.php and then all 
was fine. 
 
Original code: 
        $sql = 'SELECT *' 
             . ' FROM ' . 
PMA_backquote($cfgRelation['relation']) 
             . ' WHERE master_db   = \'' . $db . '\' ' 
             . ' AND foreign_db    = \'' . $db . '\' ' 
             . ' AND master_table  IN (' . $intable .')'; 
             . ' AND foreign_table IN (' . $intable .')'; 
 
New Code 
        $sql = 'SELECT *' 
             . ' FROM ' . 
PMA_backquote($cfgRelation['relation']) 
             . ' WHERE master_db   = \'' . $db . '\' ' 
             . ' AND master_table  IN (' . $intable .')'; 
 
In my experience a table having a relation unto itself 
is rather rare.  Mostly you have table external relations.</detail>

maybe bring in a &quot;temp&quot; selection. on the home page have a drop down box where the user selects what clicking on the table name on the left frame should show. this writes a cookie. if the cookie isnt found it uses the default of &quot;DefaultTabTable&quot;</detail>

        <title>Query results - ID: 450181</title>
        <detail>Right now, if you run a query (and not just a browse), it does not 
return the total results...it only shows you 0 to 30 and then the 
navigation buttons appear depending on whether there are more than 30 
results.  The reason for this is in lib.inc.php in the dispaly_table 
function.  This is how it should be.... 
 
 
        if (!$is_simple&amp;amp;&amp;amp;!empty($db)) { 
            $result = mysql_query($sql_query); 
            $total = mysql_num_rows($result); 
        } // end if 
 
whereas before it only ran the query for a browse by just counting all 
the rows in the table...in fact, what needs to happen is the query needs 
to be run again without LIMIT 30,0 to get the total number of rows...it 
should be quite fast and maybe this can be a configuration option to 
always calculate the total results returned...This way, you can add a 
&amp;quot;Show All&amp;quot; button that will break out of the LIMIT, useful when you want 
to get all the rows from a search repeatedly...

        <detail>this would be very useful if you have a table with lots of fields and you only want to see some fields by default 
 
for example: 
you have a table `userdata` with the fields `id`, `name`, `tel`, `bla_in`, `bla2_id`, `bla3_id`, `lots_of_uninteresting_stuff`, ..., `created` 
 
instead of  
SELECT * FROM `userdata`; 
this default query would be perfect: 
SELECT  `id`, `name`, `tel`, `created` FROM `userdata`; 
 
you could implement it maybe here: 
there is a section  
&quot;Select fields (at least one) ...&quot;  
in the search-page for a table at the bottom if you click on &quot;+ Options&quot; 
 
there could be an extra button 
&quot;store as default&quot; 
which would make the selected fields as default query for this table 
 
(at least it could store the selection for future searches with the search form)</detail>

        <title>Advanced Search - ID: 425710</title>
        <detail>One big feature that is missing in phpmyadmin is a  
whole range of search options.  
 
The search on the main.php page would search all  
fields in all databases.  
 
The search on the db-details page would search all  
fields of all the tables in the current DB. 
 
The search on the table properties page would search  
all fields in the current table.  
 
The output would create one or more html tables, each  
table would be for a different database/table, the  
tables would also contain an edit button/link.

        <title>Make margins smaller - ID: 649161</title>
        <detail>With all the information that gets crammed on the  
screen, the default border/margin (looks like about 10  
pixels?) is a waste of space. With 2 quick fixes I was  
able to gain some more realestate.. 
 
Add  
 leftmargin=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; topmargin=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; marginwidth=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;  
marginheight=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; 
to the body tag in left.php and the include php file. ie:  
&amp;lt;body leftmargin=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; topmargin=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; marginwidth=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;  
marginheight=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 
 
This would be especially nice for those with smaller  
screens. 
 
An even better idea would be to make these variables in  
the config file so we can set them to zero, 1, 10,  
whatever. 
 
------ 
 
While I'm here, I noticed that doing a file import that  
does not map 1:1 with the columns available is a bit of a  
pain.. we can enter a list of the columns to map to, but  
to get that list we have to write them down or open a  
second browser (or know them by memory). A much  
better option would be a pick list where we can turn off  
columns that don't exist in the csv/txt file.

        <title>(uploads) Fix for MySQL 3.23.49 + - ID: 589922</title>
        <detail>For MySQL 3.23.49 and later you cannot upload files from  
phpMyAdmin because this is turned off by default in the version of    
MySQL that ships with Red Hat 7.3 (3.23.49-3). 
 
More information can be found here 
http://www.mysql.com/doc/L/O/LOAD_DATA_LOCAL.html 
 
Basically if I want to upload files now I cant use phpMyAdmin, I  
have to log into the command line client  
ie : mysql -u root -p --local-infile=1 and issue the SQL query for  
inserting from here. 
 
It would be great if there was some sort of fix for this so I could  
use phpMyAdmin for uploading text files again. 
 
thanks,

        <title>distinct colors for each table - ID: 959217</title>
        <detail>it would be nice to have a color, that belongs to each  
table. this would make it easyer for the eye to  
differentiate between the tables. 
 
you could change header.inc.php in line 145 to: 
if (!empty($GLOBALS['table'])) { 
                echo '    - ' . $GLOBALS['strTable'] . ' &lt;a  
class=&quot;h1&quot; href=&quot;' . $GLOBALS['cfg']['DefaultTabTable'] .  
$header_url_qry . '&amp;amp;db=' . urlencode($GLOBALS 
['db']) . '&amp;amp;table=' . urlencode($GLOBALS['table']) . '&quot;  
style=&quot;color:#'; 
                echo word2color($GLOBALS['table']); 
                echo '&quot;&gt;' . htmlspecialchars($GLOBALS 
['table']) . '' . &quot;\n&quot;; 
            } 
 
 
this is the used function: 
 
function word2color($w){ 
        if (strlen($w)==0) return substr('00000' . dechex 
(mt_rand(0, 0xffffff)), -6); 
        while (strlen($w)&lt;6) $w.=$w; 
        $minbrightness=1;  // range from 0 to 15, if this is  
0 then for ex. black is allowed 
        $max_brightness=13; // range from 0 to 15, if this  
is 15 then for ex. white is allowed 
        $plus_red=0;    // set one of these to set the  
probability of one of these colors higher 
        $plus_green=0; 
        $plus_blue=0; 
        for ($i=0; $i&lt;6; $i++) { 
            #$r.= '&quot;&gt;';// this is a depug mode, to see the  
color written 
            $plus=0; 
            if ($plus_red0 and $i==0) $plus=$plus_red; 
            if ($plus_green0 and $i==2)  
$plus=$plus_green; 
            if ($plus_blue0 and $i==4) $plus=$plus_blue; 
            $c=$w[round(strlen($w)/6*$i)]; 
            $dec=ord($c)%($max_brightness+$plus- 
$minbrightness) +$minbrightness+$plus; 
            if ($dec&gt;$max_brightness-$minbrightness)  
$dec=$max_brightness-$minbrightness;

        <title>Automate database deployment - ID: 2964548</title>
        <detail>This request is continuation of Feature request 2964441 (see https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2964441&amp;group_id=23067&amp;atid=377411). 
 
   Synchronization, the excellent phpMyAdmin's feature, has some lack of flexibility. 
It just synchronizes one DB into another, but very frequenly the task is far more complex. 
F.e., not all tables in source database must be transferred, or brute synchronization fails because of different source/target server versions, etc. 
 
Suggestion is to let user fine-tune export &amp; import parameters. 
Let's add under listboxes &quot;Server&quot; &amp; &quot;Database&quot; (&quot;src_type&quot;, &quot;src_db_sel&quot;, &quot;trg_type&quot; &amp; &quot;trg_db_sel&quot;) a new pair of listboxes with previously bookmarked Export &amp; Import templates (see Feature request 2964441). 
 
That will entirely automate the complex database deployment process. It is very needed! 
The intermediate file (exported from source database) should be saved with unified name on phpMyAdmin's host machine. 
Its name (and other details of this complex procedure) must be reported to user. 
 
The further development of idea is to let user &quot;bookmark&quot; deployment parameters, i.e. store source/target servers &amp; databases, and export/import templates.</detail>

(sql.php?lang=...&amp;server=.&amp;db=...&amp;table=...s&amp;goto=tbl_properties.php&amp;back=tbl_properties.php&amp;sql_query=SELECT+%2A+FROM+%60...%60&amp;pos=0), 
the target action is tbl_row_delete.php (&lt;form

This name reflected the reality in previous versions, 
where rows could be only deleted. Now multiple rows can 
be deleted or updated or exported. 
 
I was a little confused when I wished to export some 
rows and the URL was tbl_row_delete.php 
 
Rename target script from tbl_row_delete.php to 
tbl_row_action.php would prevent this confusion</detail>

        <detail>Hi, 
 
A Debian user reported that increasing LoginCookieValidity did not work for him. It turned out that his PHP's session.gc_maxlifetime setting got in the way and was shorter than this timeout, so the session got garbage collected earlier. 
 
I think it should be documented at this option that the user needs to ensure that PHP's session.gc_maxlifetime is greater than the value of LoginCookieValidity. 
 
I don't think it's necessary to fiddle with session.gc_maxlifetime as phpMyAdmin as this may adversely affect other applications running on the same host.</detail>

        <title>Export to another mysql server - ID: 944328</title>
        <detail>During daily work with phpmyadmin a recurrent operation 
in our office is: 
- open pma on a local 'source' (devel) server 
- open pma on a remote 'target' (production) server 
- on source, export a few tables + data 
- copy with the mouse          (or save as file) 
- paste on target pma in the sql field.   (or using 
file upload) 
 
We could improve that by adding a new target on the 
export screens (now = to display or to file): 'export 
to server', with 4 text fields: hostname, username, 
password, database.  As return value, 'ok' or the 
remote error message should be dislpayed.  
 
comments? :)   shouldn't be hard to implement I guess. 
first simply with 4 text input fields, later maybe with 
'target server bookmarks'...</detail>

        <detail>The attached files are an update to the cookie  
authentication method so that the password can be sent  
as a hash over the internet, useful over non-SSL  
connections. 
 
The method I use on my site uses a random session  
variable which is sent with the form (CHAP login  
method) as to prevent a replay attack (eavesdropping).   
 
Before the form is sent, the random session variable and  
the entered password values are changes md5 hashes  
and then sent. 
 
The received hash values are matched against the md5  
hashes of the random session variable and the md5  
hash of the password entered in the config under the  
matched username in the config. 
 
If matched, the password entered in the config is used  
to validate the mysql login.

 SQL-query :  
 
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:\\Temp\\phpBA.tmp' INTO TABLE 
`new_resource` FIELDS TERMINATED BY ';' ENCLOSED BY '&amp;quot;' 
ESCAPED BY '\\' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' 
 
MySQL said: 
 
The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version 
 
Back 
 
Then I tried simply LOAD DATA without LOCAL and 
everything was OK. I think default parameter should be 
set on LOAD in 'LOAD mehtod' in 'Insert data from a 
textfile into table' window.  
 
Second, I think the 'Insert data from a textfile into 
table' window could be changed a little, because it is 
very inconvenient to add Column names if you are 
loading data from text file to only some of a table's 
columns. It would be easyer to see all columns selected 
and to tick a check box near it. The same idea is 
implemented in Mysql Front.  
 
I think you got the point.

        <title>(in 2.5.3-rc2) Icon Usage - ID: 787810</title>
        <detail>I am currently using version 2.5.3-rc2 from cvs and like  
the look of the new icon layout. 
 
The only problem is that the icons are really small and as  
such could benefit from some padding around them so  
the user doesn't accidently click one they didn't want. 
 
For example, if you want to click on &amp;quot;Change&amp;quot; for a field,  
you can very, very easily click on &amp;quot;Drop&amp;quot; instead as  
firstly they are next to each other, and secondly  
because there is hardly any gap between the two. 
 
I would even suggest that putting those two functions  
next to each other is not good UI design practise.  The  
main reasoning behind this is because the change button  
is probably clicked on the most out of all of the buttons  
there.  Putting drop next to change is only asking for  
trouble particularly as they have very different outcomes. 
 
Would be nice if there was an icon toolbar at the top as  
well instead of all those big boxes to save room, but  
that's another matter.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.7.0) Browse checked columns only - ID: 1275909</title>
        <detail>Hi! 
 
In the table view there is a list of fields in the 
table with checkboxes next to it. It is possible to 
Edit, Drop or create indexes on these columns. Another 
(6-th) icon that would create a SELECT statement with 
selected columns on the selected table would be very 
helpful. Specially usefull for tables with many 
columns/rows. The SELECT statement could be immediately 
executed. 
 
Greetings,

        <title>BROWSE link at top of table structure - ID: 439394</title>
        <detail>Very simple fix: Please put a 'BROWSE' link at the TOP  
of the table structure display.  Currently there is a  
link at the bottom, but this is a pain because in  
order to use it, you have to scroll down to the bottom  
of the table structure.  If your table has many  
fields, then you have to scroll down far everytime you  
want to switch from viewing the table structure to  
browsing the content. If you use PhpMyAdin hundreds of  
times a day, like I do, life would be much, much  
easier if you'd put a link at the top!</detail>

        <title>whitespace nightmare - ID: 1112998</title>
        <detail>I don't know where to post about this, but since it cost  
me over 2 hours of debugging, I thought this might be  
the best place. 
 
After building a dynamic query I ran it in phpmyadmin  
and it was successful.  When I tried to run the same  
query through a php script, I got DB errors.  The  
outputted error didn't make sense to me at the time,  
since the query was running in phpmyadmin.  After about  
2 hours of pulling my hair out over this, I finally came to  
the realization that there was an extra space after a  
function call: 
 
&quot;...WHERE ACOS (...&quot; 
 
should have been 
 
&quot;...WHERE ACOS(...&quot; 
 
PHP does not strip that whitespace away, so the query  
came up bust; phpmyadmin does (or ignores it), so the  
query worked when I ran it there. 
 
Perhaps phpmyadmin should have a setting to display a  
warning when it modifies an sql query -- even if it's just  
stripping away one character of whitespace, since  
apparently that's enough to kill the entire query in PHP.</detail>

        <detail>Hi. 
this is mostly a feat. request but can be a bug on the other side. 
phpmyadmin is in use for several people! customer with view only access, developer and server administrators.  
well in some points the configuration need to be extended i think.  
 
A feature in config.inc is needed to disable maintainance functions like optimize, repair and so on.  
on very large databases a simple click on this function can break or strongly slow down a hole platform for hours! ... killing those processes will be the next bad idea if you want to crash you table/database.

        <title>(Dump) read sql-dump-file uploaded via ftp (in 2.3.1) - ID: 468745</title>
        <detail>first of all: thanks to you guy for improving this  
tool so much. 
 
here is the problem - i guess that there are many  
people like me testing their db on a local host and  
then have to transfer the data to their public  
webspace. though most providers have restricted the  
fileupload to 2MB (php-standard-value) the html-upload  
is not possible. even smaller files ( &amp;gt; 1MB) produced  
(i my case) time-out/server errors. 
it would be great if you could implement the  
possibility to read the sql-dump from a file stored on  
the server, so this file could be uploaded with ftp. 
 
sorry asking for new features instead of sending code - 
 but if some of our projects will be finished there  
hopefully will be more time to spend with open-source- 
coding. 
 
thanks

        <title>the listing of many databases on phpMyAdmin - ID: 1359456</title>
        <detail>A feature I recently came up with that I personally  
could do with is to have the listing under the  
following line on the web browser be more enhanced. 
 
--- 
Please select a database 
--- 
 
I am about to add over 250 new databases onto the  
list of databases we run on our websites. Even if I  
logged in with my own login I would still need to  
deal with a list of over 300 databases (old ones plus  
the 250 new ones I am adding, so the existing feature  
of giving me a personal login other than the root  
login is not suitable. 
 
My idea probably needs a rethink on how phpMyAdmin  
displays on the screen, and I think that splitting  
the functionality of database listing the left column  
has would help. In this column is listed the 10 most  
recent databases worked on and then it lists a link  
to another page where the real listing power goes on.  
The listing format in the main column would be  
something like this: 
 
--- 
Please select a database 
 
database1 
database2 
database3 
database4 
database5 
database6 
database7 
database8 
database9 
database10 
 
Select other databases &lt;-- that's a hyperlink to page  
two of the database listing 
--- 
 
I know there is a databases link on the index page  
which takes you to the page where you can check  
privileges ( /phpadmin/server_databases.php ) but  
this page is not what I am after. Nor am I after the  
existing user management already in the software.  
 
I am after a tool that will allow me to organise and  
manage my many databases by grouping them by website,  
e.g. if of the above databases number 3, 4 and 5 were  
for website wibble.com and 1, 6 and 10 for wobble.com  
I can tick them on the list on the page and assign a  
common name for them. I would type in the name I  
assign the group. 
 
Now when I look at the &quot;Please select a database&quot;  
listing it would look like this: 
 
--- 
Please select a database 
 
wibble.com 
database3 
database4 
database5 
 
wobble.com 
database1 
database6 
database10 
 
Not Assigned 
database2 
database7 
database8 
database9 
 
Select other databases 
--- 
 
As you can see the listing has changed such that I  
can now see which databases belong to which website. 
 
A further function is for me to be able to hide and  
unhide databases from this listing. Similar to the  
ability to assign access privileges so that I only I  
can access a database, but not my colleague. This  
function can be applied on the &quot;Select other  
databases&quot; page to allow to hide any databases I am  
not working on. So for example if I am updating  
databases for wobble.com, I can select the &quot;Hide  
database&quot; option on the page while I am assigning it  
to a group. Maybe it would want a page for editing  
this instead. Once it's marked to hide, it does not  
show on the main listing, plus I can also hide any  
databases not assigned as well. So if I applied that  
I do not want to see wobble.com or not assigned  
databases, the listing would look like this: 
 
--- 
Please select a database 
 
wibble.com 
database3 
database4 
database5 
 
Select other databases 
--- 
 
However if you have many databases for a single  
website (for example if you just got one website or  
many websites with many databases), it would also be  
worthwhile to further group databases for a group by  
functionality, so if you had this functionality as  
well, I could then group relevant databases for  
wibble.com AND sub-group them further. 
 
--- 
Please select a database 
 
wibble.com 
   usermanagement 
      database3 
   products 
      database4 
      database5 
 
Select other databases 
--- 
 
A reset button on the &quot;Select other databases&quot; page  
resets ALL groups at once, with window to confirm  
whether you want to do this. 
 
I think this will be a major improvement to a product  
that is already very useful, and I hope it will be  
taken under consideration for the next major update.</detail>

        <title>Show Fieldnames in Querys - ID: 961520</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
i had following idea: i write a PHP-script und i use  
phpmyadmin. Good Script doesn`t have a `Select  
*-Clause, they list a row of fields. So, it es great, when  
i can copy such a string from phpmyadmin to my String. 
 
I built this idea in the version, i installed at my computer  
and it works how i expected. 
 
for exampel I changed following code in tbl_query_box. 
php 
 
old: 
&lt;?php echo ((!empty($query_to_display)) ?  
htmlspecialchars($query_to_display) : 'SELECT * FROM ' .  
htmlspecialchars(PMA_backquote($table)) . ' WHERE 1');  
?&gt; 
 
new:  
&lt;?php 
$felder = &quot;&quot;; 
$rpresult      = @PMA_mysql_query(&quot;SHOW FIELDS FROM  
&quot;. PMA_backquote($db) .&quot;.&quot;. PMA_backquote($table) ); 
while ($rprow = PMA_mysql_fetch_array($rpresult)) 
{ 
 $felder .= $felder ? ', '. $rprow['Field'] :  $rprow['Field']; 
} 
echo ((!empty($query_to_display)) ?  
htmlspecialchars($query_to_display) : 'SELECT '. $felder .'  
FROM ' . htmlspecialchars(PMA_backquote($table)) . '  
WHERE 1'); ?&gt; 
 
for more information, you can look at:

Could you show the databases as a list instead of as a

    apache_note('userID', $mysql_cur_user_and_host);

        <title>Keep current tab index - ID: 2977290</title>
        <detail>A very common stage of database development is creating or modifying the database structure. 
Databases consist of more than one table, but switching between them in phpMyAdmin always leads to returning to Browse tab, over and over again. 
So common scenario during database development is: 
1 Go to Structure tab of some table, &lt;&lt;&lt; 
2 Edit smth, 
3 Go to another table by link in the left frame, phpMyAdmin resets to Browse tab, 
1a Go to Structure tab of 2nd table, &lt;&lt;&lt; 
... 
 
Suggestion is to remember &amp; restore tab index when switching the current table by left frame. 
At least, don't reset Structure tab to Browse tab. Maybe, make this feature optional.</detail>

relationship has been established, foreign key fields on  
the insert record page should switch to drop-down  
menus with lookups to the specified display field.  In  
addition, a shortcut link should be added next to the  
drop-down for &amp;quot;add new&amp;quot; which would link directly to an  
insert record screen (preferably pop-up, though those  
don't seem to be used in phpMyAdmin much) for the  
foreign table. 
 
Instead of a drop-down, a search / lookup record pop-up  
could be used, similar to user administration in PHPBB.</detail>

        <title>OnClick for comfortable data editing - ID: 516357</title>
        <detail>In a result table generated by sql.php there is a  
hover implemented, that highlights the data row.

onmouseout=&amp;quot;setPointer(this, '#DDDDDD')&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

My idea is to implement an onClick, that leads to the  
edit mask for this database entry (tbl_change.php)  
analog in the same manner as the &amp;quot;edit&amp;quot; button.

        <title>Make the &lt;hr /&gt; style match eachother ? - ID: 995058</title>
        <detail>Hello everyone, 
 
I've taken notice in phpMyAdmin 2.6.0 that you've  
redone the design. 
 
One thing that makes me question is the  tags  
that you use in there. 
 
On the upper left hand side, you use a standard   
tag that has a shadow and no edited effect. 
 
Whereas if you are browsing any page on the right hand  
side, it is more flat (and much cooler looking in my  
opinion). 
 
I think it would be relevant if both the left side and the  
right side matched. 
 
Thanks. 
 
Best of luck to you, 
- Mike Sadowski.</detail>

        <title>(ok 2.10.0) Using input could corrupt data in varchar - ID: 1224791</title>
        <detail>PROBLEM: 
 
newlines in strings and all following signs will be 
removed from varchar fields if edited in phpmyadmin. 
 
LOOK AT THIS CASE: 
 
On my website I offer a textarea element to create data 
for a varchar field in my mysql database because I want 
the user to be able to use newlines - despite the 
varchars shortness up to 255 signs. 
 
These newlines are stored in the database correctly. 
And if I open the record on my website again it appers 
correctly in the textarea. 
 
But if I open the record to edit it in phpmyadmin this 
varchar field is shown in an input element wich has 
only one line! I can only see the first line of my data. 
 
In the value attribute of phpmyadmins text element 
these newlines are transmitted as %0D%0A but they are 
not displayed in the element. 
 
If I submit the phpmyadmin form the data of this field 
is corrupted, because the other lines are removed. 
 
I think this is very importand because everyone 
considers data not to be damaged if just opened and 
closed in phpmyadmins editor. 
 
SOLUTION: 
 
Content of varchar field must be displayed in small 
textareas if it includes newlines.  
 
EXTENDED IDEA: 
 
If no data (or one line data) is shown the user could 
be able to select whether he wants to see an input-text 
or an textarea - perhaps with a small button to switch 
between these options.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.5.0) InnoDB and select count(*) - ID: 708533</title>
        <detail>The function used to find the number of rows in a table  
is probably select count(*) from table_name. While this  
might be extremely fast for MyIsam tables, it is  
ridiculously slow for large InnoDB tables. 
 
For InnoDB tables the &amp;quot;show table statistics&amp;quot; command  
is almost immediate and correct ennough. For InnoDB  
tables, InnoDB reads the whole table to determine the  
count (*). 
 
It would be nice if you guys could determine the # of  
rows depending on the DB type?

        <title>Export tables in predefined order - ID: 722218</title>
        <detail>I modified the export routines to read a file that sets up a  
predefined order for the exporting of the tables.  This is  
very handy for me as we enforce integrity rules, so I  
can't just use an alpahbetical export and import.  They  
need to be in the correct order.  The user can check the  
box to read order from file, which then reads in the order  
for the tables.  The file must be called export_order.inc. 
php and must be sitting in the root of phpMyAdmin. 
 
If you don't select any of the tables from the select box  
then it will export everything in the order it is in the file.   
If you select tables then it will export only the selected  
tables in the correct order they should be exported in. 
 
I only tested and set it up for the SQL type, not XML,  
CVS, or Latex. 
 
I used the latest 2.5.0-rc1 release to make the changes  
in. 
 
Attached are the files I changed along with an example of  
the export_order.inc.php file.</detail>

        <title>Include offset information in paginated navigation - ID: 1795876</title>
        <detail>This is specifically about the database list in the navigation, introduced in version 2.11.0. 
 
On a server with a very large number of database (2000+) where the database names are not very normalized (1000 might all begin with the letter 'c'), it requires a lot of clicking to locate a specific database.  The same might also apply to a database with a very large number of tables. 
 
I would like to propose a couple of options to help this: 
 
1) In the &quot;Page Number&quot; select, include the first record on each page.  Example: 
 
  Page Number: 
  1 
  2 
  3 
  4 
 
might become 
 
  Page Number: 
  1 (database_alpha...) 
  2 (database_golf...) 
  3 (database_november...) 
  4 (dtabase_tango...) 
 
Then it becomes possible to identify which page a particular database is on without guessing. 
 
An additional (or alternate) option might be to add a text box on the main page to open a specific database by name: 
 
* [Binary Log] 
* [Databases] 
    by name: [ textinput ] [ Submit ] 
* [Export] 
* [Import]</detail>

        <detail>After having inserted some HTML code via a text field, the sql code (which was used to insert the data) gets displayed, and with it, of course, the HTML. 
 
 
This HTML should be escaped via PHP's htmlspecialchars(), and since it doesn't it is interpreted by the browser, which is awfully annoying. 
 
 
It's a minor problem, but as I have a comment-function on my website, where you are allowed to enter HTML, it's really strange to change the database entries with this &quot;bug&quot; ... if you can call it a bug.

        <title>Default Charset backwards compatibility - ID: 1091081</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
I run MySQL 4.1.7 on my home computer as part of my PHP 
app developing environment. Using PMA 2.6.0, It adds 
the DEFAULT CHARSET and COLLATION entries when 
exporting structure (and data). The problem is -- that 
not every website I develop uses such a modern version 
of MySQL on their remote server. The PMA versions they 
use are not expecting these newer commands, and hence 
return errors. 
 
It's simple to manually delete them and upload the 
edited sql file or simply enter the text into the query 
box under &quot;SQL&quot;, howerver with having to import data 
(in such a field that has 30,000 rows) can put a big 
strain on my browser, not to mention taking ages on 
this &quot;supposive&quot; 512K Thai DSL connection. 
 
It would be nice to have it exported as a .gz, edit it 
and repack the GZ, but I haven't the software to 
re-pack files into a gz, so I am forced to upload the 
entire sql file or text into the textfield. 
 
It would be nice to see a checkbox or the like that 
could be checked to remove such modern comments, for 
backwards compatibilty.

        <title>Adding query history using browser's localStorage - ID: 3525904</title>
        <detail>One painful aspect of working on  phpmyadmin for our team was to lose our hard formed, 8 line queries during session timeouts. Hence I created a Chrome Extension and a Firefox addon to save the queries in browser's localStorage and make them searcheable. I turned the query textarea itself into an autocomplete. I thought I would integrate this feature into phpmyadmin itself. Check out my extensions on https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ffimgldnoigmlcofmfkfcjechbdkipph?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon and https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dlq/?src=ss and use them with phpmyadmin. Also check them with phpminiadmin to see the slick UI and accessibility I have added using twitter bootstrap, currently not implemented on phpmyadmin since addon requires DOM manipulation and phpminiadmin and phpmyadmin have different DOM structures. 
 
Please take a decision if phpmyadmin is willing to accept this enhancement. I shall integrate it with the code and send a pull request on github.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.6.0) Encrypted password valid for limited time amount - ID: 902295</title>
        <detail>As it stands, a cookie hijacker can steal the encrypted  
pass out of the cookie and log into PHPMyAdmin  
whenever he/she wants. It is also easy for him to be re- 
assured that the user/pass is the right one (by the  
username.) 
 
I would suggest encrypting the username to make every  
user that is logged into the network look the same. This  
would also make it imposable to see if root or some other  
targeted user is logged in at the time. 
 
I would also like to propose a method where a hijacker  
could only hijack the user/pass for a specified period of  
time. (Lets say three hours... or let the user decide in  
the config file.) 
 
This will be accomplished by: 
 
 
Preparation: 
1. Specify a time variance between clicks. (Log out time  
delay) 
 
Cookie Encoding: 
1. Send a cookie with the Date/Time &amp; Variance  
encrypted with the blowfish pass (BlowPass) in the  
config file. Overwrite the Date/Time but NOT the  
variance. 
 
2. Create another pass by combining the Date/Time,  
Variance  &amp; BlowPass. (md5... maybe) The variance is  
optional and may only slightly slow a hacker. 
 
3. Encrypt the User and Pass with the new  
DateTimeBlowPass. 
 
4. Send the encrypted User and Pass in a cookie. 
 
 
 
Authenticating: 
 
1. Decrypt the Date/Time with BlowPass 
 
2. If Date/Time out of variance, Log Out! 
 
2. Use Date/Time and BlowPass to recreate  
DateTimeBlowPass. 
 
3. Unencrypt User/pass. 
 
4. Check if authorized with MySQL. 
 
5. Update Date/Time cookie with current Date/Time. 
 
Wala. The encrypted pass sent to a users computer is  
now time sensitive. If the time variance is out of range,  
the encrypted pass cannot be used! This secures the  
front-end (without sessions) as much as I can rap my  
mind around today. 
 
 
Sending the variance in the cookie is optional. It may  
only add a small amount of security. The idea behind it is  
that if the hacker has write permissions to the config  
file, he could change the variance to be huge, allowing  
him/her to use the time sensitive cookie for an extended  
period of time. However if the user could write to the  
config file, he could no doubt create a little program to  
capture the user/pass when they were entered &amp;  
numerous other things. 
 
I would be happy to make these modifications if you  
would like.</detail>

        <title>data export within a query result - ID: 785883</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
I often need to extract some few record of table (not  
the whole table). 
 
Currently, I'm counting the rank of the record in the  
query result, and i'm using the standart export tools for  
the table (extract n rows from the rank x). 
 
It would be useful to have a check box on each row,  
that allow to select which row we want the sql Insert  
generated. (or CSV or else if the query use more than  
one table)

        <title>Wastebin for tables - ID: 1171276</title>
        <detail>I am after a feature that I could enable on PHPMyAdmin  
when enabled, would mean that a dropped table or  
dropped database isn't actually dropped by means of a  
administrator-only setting on the software. 
 
What I envisage would happen is that someone  
accidentally deletes an important table or when  
someoone from outside does a DoS attack on  
someone's database and does Drop Database. Instead  
of the database disappearing into a black hole, it  
actually gets moved to a hidden special database  
(which the administrator of the PHPMyAdmin can  
specify in the settings for this function) and an alert is  
emailed to the administrator stating the name of the  
table or database just dropped, the time and date it  
happened, and details of who was logged in at the time  
it happened. In case of DoS or similar it would track the  
originating IP address (if possible) and then report that  
to the administrator. 
 
This is a feature I need for my work so it is a pretty  
urgent feature wanted, and I am sure that it could be  
useful for the overall way that PHPMyAdmin works. 
 
Thanks for listening,

        <detail>We would dearly like a Xampp version for use by non-developers for standalone local use. 
These users run HTML/Javascript apps as stanadalone or on small LANs entirely behind the firewall. 
The new Firefox 4 and Chrome 6 are becoming such a rich semipermanent to develop user interfaces for any application, not just web. 
 
Problem is these users can never edit the config. 
So the following defaults would be ideal. 
 
php.ini 
----------------------- 
extension=php_dbase.dll (dbase extension is start up option on linx)  
post_max_size=900M             (or no limit) 
upload_max_filesize=900M       (or no limit) 
memory_limit=900M              (or no limit) 
max_input_time=36000           (or no limit) 
max_execution_time=36000       (or no limit)  
session.gc_maxlifetime=36000   (or no limit) 
mysql.connect_timeout=-1 
 
 
MySql Configuration 
----------------------- 
ft_min_word_len=3  (default is 4)  
max_allowed_packet=16000000  (default 1mb) 
 
 
I know that max_execution_time is needed to stop run away scripts but developers can change it where as casual users will not. 
 
The php_dbase.dll is a start switch on Linux. This will be very useful for the next few years as the import from legacy xbase applications  
 
The max_allowed_packet is for the increasing use of MySql geometry field for GIS apps.</detail>

This would also make it a little more simple for people like

        <detail>Hello! 
 
I am using phpMyAdmin on a system with an important number of databes (above 2.000 databases). The system itself for a small number of databases is great, but when you start to have dozen of pages, picking up the right database is a &quot;pain in the ass&quot; if you excuse me for the expression. 
 
I often have to browse 4 or 5 pages, and then in the page double check to be sure not to click on the wrong database name. 
 
Instead of a combobox, it would be really nice to have an input like google suggest who would populate results based on a search. Or any other way of selecting a base through a search.

        <title>logging function for changes in rows (and maybe more) - ID: 1210930</title>
        <detail>i'm a programmer for a browsergame with php&amp;mysql. 
because i gave access to mysql through phpmyadmin to 
some guys i wanted to log all changes they do in rows. 
since there is no such feature in phpmyadmin i wanted 
to ask if that could be implemented in future versions. 
 
for now, because i really need this, i just changed it 
like this (it's still the version 2.5.4): 
tbl_replace.php, line 176: 
$sql_query = $query . ';'; 
 
$local_query             = 'SELECT VERSION() as 
version, USER() as user'; 
$res                     = 
PMA_mysql_query($local_query) or PMA_mysqlDie('', 
$local_query, FALSE, ''); 
$mysql_cur_user_and_host = PMA_mysql_result($res, 0, 
'user'); 
$mysql_cur_user          = 
substr($mysql_cur_user_and_host, 0, 
strrpos($mysql_cur_user_and_host, '@')); 
 
$datei = fopen(&quot;changes.log&quot;, &quot;a+&quot;); 
fwrite($datei, date(&quot;d-m-Y H:i&quot;).&quot; &quot;.$mysql_cur_user.&quot;: 
&quot;.$sql_query.&quot;\n&quot;); 
fclose($datei); 
$result    = PMA_mysql_query($query); 
 
it's just done quickly, some copy&amp;paste from main.php 
(for getting the username which is logged in) and 
writing in a file (as you actually can see yourself ;). 
 
it would be nice to have a possibility to log changes 
which are done (my version just logs changes in rows 
since i only need this and not more) directly by 
enabling it in the conf file. probably there are other 
users who need that feature too.</detail>

        <detail>Would it be possible to do all of the configuration  
via web? Basically, just have the user drop the  
program into the directory, chmod a couple files, and  
point their browser. 
 
Some ideas on this tangent: 
- Actual configuration data is in a primary database,  
a config file gets rebuilt everytime a user  
adds/deletes a server. 
 
- upgrading and configuration can be done &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot; 
 
- easier to enforce security? 
 
- by continuing to have a config file, entire app is  
not at the whim of a single database. 
 
Any ideas are welcome, if you would like to see how  
some people have implemented something similar, check  
out the installation process of Phorum 3.3.x

The reason for this is so that you can browse the data

It is still accessible on the left frame next to the

        <detail>Sorry, I don't speak english really good and don't really  
know how to call my feature request, so I'll try to  
explain it to you. 
 
The problem is that you get only one mysql-database at  
some webspace-providers like 1&amp;amp;1 Puretec in Germany. I  
have about 5 different projects running on this databse,  
and so in this databse are ATM 60 tables. 
Because of the fact that all tables have a certain prefix,  
for exmaple &amp;quot;phpbb_&amp;quot; for tables regarding to the phpBB- 
Forum or &amp;quot;edel_&amp;quot; for another project, it would be nice to  
get the ability to create groups for the tables - so for  
exmaple a group called &amp;quot;phpBB&amp;quot;, which holds all tables  
beginning with &amp;quot;phpbb_&amp;quot; and so on. you would only see  
the names of the groups with a &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; in front of it, so that  
you'd have to click on a group to show the tables  
regarding to it. 
 
this feature would, IMHO, add a lot of comfort to  
phpMyAdmin.

        <detail>The ability to choose to export a set of records and all related records based on the relations defined in phpMyAdmin. 
 
Use Case: 
I would like to move a customer from 1 database to another database. I need to export their account record, and also any campaigns referencing that account and also any groups referencing that campaign and so on. Ideally it would be a top down export that let's me choose the account record and then looks for all references to that account record and does so recursively down the tree. It would use the relations I have already defined in phpMyAdmin.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.6.0) Filter db structure on group of nested tables - ID: 870163</title>
        <detail>When the user clicks on the common name of a group of  
nested tables in the left frame, the right frame displays  
the structure of the entire database that contains this  
group of nested tables. 
 
IMO it would be useful if db_details_structure.php could  
be modified so that in this scenario it only displays  
information about the tables that belong to the group  
the user clicked on.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.5.1) display wide textarea when type is longtext  - ID: 737174</title>
        <detail>A slight modification to the way phpMyAdmin displays 'longtext', it will not display the textarea element to the right of a row (just like any other type), but instead it will start a new row beneath it and use the entire width of the table to display the textarea element. 
 
I found this useful for editing large chunks of HTML that were stored in a 'longtext'... 
 
Maybe it's worth an extra config var (wideLongtext = TRUE ???). 
 
included is a patch for 'tbl_change.php' taken from the 2.5.0 release</detail>

        <detail>To be honest, this isn't necessary and it'd probably  
demand a ton of rewriting.  That being said, it's natural  
for new PHP users to check out the extensions available  
via PEAR, Horde, or (name your favorite site).   
 
Personally, the first place I went when I started looking  
for extensions was PEAR.  If the goal of this program is  
to help _new users_ learn MySQL, then it makes sense  
to upload the source to one of these major extension  
depositories.  Let them help expose phpMyAdmin to  
other people looking for help with databases.</detail>

        <detail>When displaying a list of all the tables in the left frame: 
In stead of listing all the databases in the left frame (either with a dropdownlist or with links), is it possible to create a link to go to the 'databaseList'-view? (see implemented attached example) 
This has some advantages: 
- No request for database names when in 'left_tableList' (= extra speed). 
- No extra space in the navigation area (just the space of the link in stead of the dropdownlist) 
- No extra clicks when comparing to dropdownlist.</detail>

        <title>BadUsers Config and Auth - ID: 896335</title>
        <detail>Hi,  
 
it would be fine to configure bad-users. Example: 
Hosting for many databases using PhpMyAdmin. I would 
like to disable root and some other usernames from 
login. I've done a little patch in an older version, 
but it would be fine to have it on the official version : 
 
added to config.inc.php: 
 
 $cfg[&quot;badusers&quot;]=array( 
  &quot;root&quot;, 
  &quot;xyz&quot; 
 ); 
 
added to libraries/auth/cookie.auth.lib.php in  
  function PMA_auth_check(): 
 
        foreach ($cfg[&quot;badusers&quot;] as $tmpuser) { 
         if ($pma_username==$tmpuser) { //XXTH NO ROOT 
HERE ;) 
           return FALSE; 
         } 
        } 
( I think in_array also would work ) 
 
Since I only use cookie auth I've only added it there, 
but it would be no problem to add it at the other Auth 
type(s). 
 
 
Thank you for reading ;)

I wish to help someone avoid the 3 hours I just spent [silly me]. 
 
Basically, I upgraded phpMyAdmin. In reality, I copied all the databases from an old machine to a new one with a more recent version of phpMyAdmin. Nonetheless. The pmadb was missing pma_designer_coord. And it was reported as a missing feature. In attempts to &quot;fix&quot; the missing feature (none of which appeared to work): 
 
I added the line in config.inc.php 
I added the table with the SQL tab on phpMyAdmin with a copy/paste from the create_tables.sql file. 
I deleted the whole pmadb database and recreated it from the script. 
I restarted the server. 
I started tracing the code (really nicely written by the way; but dense...) 
I grepped for &quot;Displaying Column Comments&quot; and found it in lang/english-utf8.inc.php 
I grepped for &quot;strColComFeat&quot; and found it in ....  
blah blah blah on into stubborn debug mode 
 
ultimately, I finally deleted my cookies. Ta-Dah! 
 
Could you please add a bit of text to PMA_printRelationsParamDiagnostic() to the effect of:  
&quot;after making changes, please clear your cookies...&quot; 
 
Thanks. 
 
btw: phpMyAdmin rocks. Thank you very much.</detail>

        <detail>Hi, 
 
When I create a table in greek language and fill in any 
fields  
with greek entries then what I get to see when 
displaying the contents with phpMyAdmin is something 
like &quot;&amp;#927;&quot; for a  
greek character. 
 
Is it a bug or a missing feature? 
 
Thanks

        <detail>hi 
                I just wants to tell there is the option in  
phpmyadmin to export csv file. But that is also not  
working well like if you export csv with html data (chose  
simple csv not &quot;CSV for MS Excel&quot; option) the Excel file  
will not be ok. The lines will be brack whenever you will  
find br,&quot;\n(New line character)&quot;. 
                And i also want to ask there is no option to  
import csv file in phpmyadmin. 
 
Thank you,

        <title>(in 2.5.3) Display output of multiple SQL commands - ID: 771282</title>
        <detail>The short form is that when I enter one SQL command  
in the windows below the tables (say SELECT), when I  
execute it, I see the results. If I put two commands in  
that window I do not see the results of each command. 
 
I am interfacing to an external program which can  
generate anywhere from 50 to 1000 mySQL UPDATE  
commands to change prices on our web data base. Each  
UPDATE command affects only one item in the DB. So I  
need to see the results of each UPDATE and I dont need  
the script to blow before it gets to the end. Just  
execute and tell me what didn't work and I will fix the  
ones that didnt work. 
 
At www.networkshosting.com I had this ability and  
thought it would be a pretty normal thing to have. 
 
I have tried on two different WSP's to get resolution  
without results. Please tell me you have an answer to  
this rather simple need. 
 
As one of my computer science professors used to tell  
me, an ugly program that works is infinitely better that a  
pretty one that doesn't.

        <title>For editing long tables, allow SELECT - ID: 1780867</title>
        <detail>If in a long table a few fields per record are to be edited manually, much scrolling is needed to find the field(s) in all those record, and too easily records may be overlooked. 
This could be made much easier if a kind of SELECT were allowed to reduce the number of fields displayed in the edit screen. This way, we might SELECT only those fields that are to be editied as well as a few more fields needed to check which records must edited and which not.</detail>

        <title>File-based User specific configuration - ID: 1463987</title>
        <detail>In my environment, I have several different  
programmer/dba that need to access different  
databases. With a minor change to common.lib.php I  
have been able to implement that by giving each user  
their own configuration file which provides access to  
the specific databases they need. 
 
It gets the logged in username from the server,  
removes the domain in the case of Windows, and checks  
for a user specific configuration file. 
 
 
/** 
 * Detects the config file we want to load 
 */ 
$config_to_load = &quot;./config.inc.php&quot;; 
$username = @$_SERVER[&quot;PHP_AUTH_USER&quot;]; 
$arr = explode(&quot;\\&quot;,$username); 
$username = end($arr); 
if ($username != &quot;&quot;) { 
  if (file_exists('./config_' .  
$username . '.inc.php')) { 
    $config_to_load = './config_' .  
$username . '.inc.php'; 
    } 
  } 
$_SESSION['PMA_Config'] = new PMA_Config 
($config_to_load); 
//    $_SESSION['PMA_Config'] = new PMA_Config 
('./config.inc.php'); 
 
 
I have made this change to a couple of different  
versions and think it may be helpful to others. It  
would also eliminate my need to customize with each  
update.

        <title>(in 2.6.0) Themes need minimum PMA version - ID: 991645</title>
        <detail>Allow a theme to specify in its colors.inc.php a minimum version of  
PMA with which it will work. If you consider that PMA's themability  
has only just begun and will likely expand in the future, and if you  
envision eventual 3rd-party themes that may be distributed  
separate from PMA, then it would be a bad idea for a user to install  
a theme designed for, say, PMA 2.7.1 into PMA 2.6.0. It wouldn't  
look right, and the user might never know that it wasn't supposed  
to look that way. 
 
PMA should either only show in the menu those themes that work  
with that PMA version, or an error message could be displayed on  
the main menu (the way it is when certain other config options are  
incorrect) informing the user that they need to upgrade PMA to use  
theme &quot;x&quot;.</detail>

        <detail>It would be useful to add an option to the Export page 
of PHPMyAdmin that is a check box called something like 
&quot;Add 'disable foreign key checks'&quot; . Then when the user 
would check the box he would get an exported sql file 
that has: 
 
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0; 
 
at the beginning of the file, and: 
 
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1; 
 
at the end of the file. 
 
This helps immensely when moving data between InnoDB 
tables, it also speeds up importing by a lot.

        <title>Link for viewing Rows related to current row - ID: 923734</title>
        <detail>in 'Browse-Table'-View or in 'Edit-Row'-View there 
sh/could be a link to view all related Rows from a 
relationed-table! 
 
f.e.: 
 
`tab1`.`id` 
 
`tab2`.`id` 
`tab2`.`tab1_id` 
 
 
in Browse-View for Table `tab1` you can now easily 
switch to: 
 
SELECT * 
FROM `tab2` 
WHERE `tab1_id` = [SELECTED_TAB1_ID] 
 
or any other relation defined in the PMA-Relation-Table 
 
a possible way could be, you can select one or more 
rows (with the allready existing checkboxes) and there 
is an additonal butten below the view, next to 'Edit' 
and 'Delete' and a selectbox if more then one table is 
related to this table</detail>

one could still access other dbs e.g.

MySQL user (only needed with basic auth) 
$cfgServers[1]['password']      = '';          //

        <title>SUM and AVG in browse table-view - ID: 951606</title>
        <detail>i think to people with not such a great skill in SQL 
there should be offered more of the great 
functionlalities that SQL-Queries have. 
 
a dropdownbox underneath the table in the &quot;browse&quot; view 
with all fields of that table and a second option if 
you want to see SUM(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX() or AVG() 
of all fields with a numeric type grouped by the field 
selected in the first dropdownbox - if you press that 
button, you will be led to the page with a query like this: 
SELECT field_1, SUM(field_2), SUM(field_3), SUM(field_4) 
FROM `table_x`GROUP BY field_1 
 
more functionality could be offered for example 
date-sort Queries or date select funcions like 
FROM_UNIXTIME() or DATE_FORMAT() (see:

        <detail>I am using phpMyAdmin - 2.11.8.1 and when I export data from a table containing a TIMESTAMP column, the values in the output are the same as the ones shown by the 'Browse' view. That is, they're auto-adjusted by the MySQL server via the time_zone server/session option. 
 
This has a consequence when using phpmyadmin to export data for migration across different timezones: the times would all get messed up. 
 
Potential solutions: 
- adjust from system to UTC before exporting, adjust from UTC to system before importing 
or 
- place a 'SET time_zone=...' query at the beginning of the exported output (can be tricky if the server's timezone is SYSTEM)</detail>

        <title>taking AUTO_INCREMENT into account - ID: 500621</title>
        <detail>problem: 
1. Dump a DB with a AUTO_INCREMENT column, where one  
row has the value of '0' in that column. 
2. Run the dumped file thru phpMyAdmin 
3. As it should, the mysql server inserts the rows and  
the field which originally had a value of '0' with a  
different value, often causing duplicate rows(if it  
happens to be a primary key column, which it almost  
always is when dealing with AUTH_INCREMENTing indices). 
 
solution: 
1. check for auto_increment and value of 0 
2. add an UPDATE query after inserting all the rows  
setting that specific row back to 0 to ensure that the  
DB's are identical. 
 
this is no bug in the MySQL server, but rather a  
malfunction of your client. You should take into  
account the fact that people dump very large DB's  
(such as a forum with 6-7,000 posts) and finding these  
errors in a 500KB large text file is quite a pain.</detail>

        <title>Automatic table alias in SQL query area - ID: 2956128</title>
        <detail>When I write SQL queries involving multiple tables, I usually have to start by adding table aliases to the SQL code in the query area manually.  
After adding table aliases (e.g. prefixing a columns in the customer table with &quot;c.&quot;) a few million times, I have been thinking that it would be better if PhpMyAdmin could do it automatically? Automatic table aliasing is one of the huge time savers when using the query GUI in MS-Access.  
 
Example 
Instead of a default Default Query Table created by a setting like  
$cfg['DefaultQueryTable'] = 'SELECT \n\t %f FROM %d.%t \n WHERE 1 \n;  
 
 
SELECT  
	id, 
	firstName, 
	lastName, 
	employment_date 
FROM test.customers 
;  
 
PhpMyadmin could write a default query like this....  
 
SELECT  
	c.id, 
	c.firstName, 
	c.lastName, 
	c.employment_date 
FROM test.customers c 
;  
 
 
Maybe a column's table default table alias may default to the first letter of the table name, unless a table alias is stored in a e.g. pma_table_alias</detail>

        <title>(ok 3.4) store browse preferences (in cookies?) - ID: 1107531</title>
        <detail>I love 'phpmyadmin'. Very useful. However, I have a  
usability issue that could be solved easily, I would think. 
 
For the type of work I'm doing, browsing/selecting by  
LIMIT'ing 30 rows at a time doesn't really work for me. I  
need to see all lines, or at least a group considerably  
bigger than just 30 rows, in a table. As a result, I have  
to change the display settings each and every time (e.g.  
3000 rows, starting with row 0). It is just annoying  
having to do that, and it doesn't make sense.  
 
Would it be possible to just store these preference  
settings in a cookie or so?  You can even make it so  
that there is a checkmark-box to give the user control  
over the existence of such a cookie, just like many log- 
on screens nowadays?</detail>

SELECT id, text, language FROM table WHERE language = 'cs_cz' ORDER BY text ASC;

        <title>show all quick field actions in table structure - ID: 3319258</title>
        <detail>When browsing the structure of a table in a database, there are certain actions for each field in the table, like delete, modify, make primary key etc. 
 
The &quot;delete&quot; and &quot;modify&quot; actions are visible, while all the other actions fall under the &quot;more&quot; category, which shows up when moving the mouse over it. 
 
I think it would be most useful to let users decide which actions they want to be always visible, and which can be hidden. For example, someone with a large screen, like me, would probably choose to always show them all. 
 
The same concept could also be applied to the tabs (Browse, Structure, SQL, etc), in order to hide some of them if you have a small screen.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.7.1) Config. variable for default collation connection - ID: 1025969</title>
        <detail>Using MySQL 4.1.4 and phpMyAdmin 2.6.0-rc2. 
 
My MySQL database has the default collation of 
latin1_swedish_ci, 
which accounding to the MySQL docs, is the most common one. 
 
phpMyAdmin comes with a default collation connection of  
utf8_general_ci.  That can be changed on the home page by 
choosing from a drop-down list.  But, I need to tell 
all users 
in my company to manually make that change, else they 
get the error: 
#1267 - Illegal mix of collations 
(latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) and 
(utf8_general_ci,COERCIBLE) for operation '=' 
 
If I could instead modify a config variable in 
config.inc.php, that 
would be much easier. 
 
As a temp. workaround for my site, I followed lem9's advice 
and modified libraries/common.lib.php.  If the cookie 
does not 
contain a value for collation_connection, I hardcode it to  
&quot;latin1_swedish_ci&quot;.  If instead, that could come from a 
config variable, that would be great. 
 
   Thanks!

        <detail>Hello, 
 
It currently looks like phpMyAdmin uses a Create table statement, and then inserts data using a sub select on the table. (Method found in Operations tab of a table) A much faster way would be to use &quot;RENAME TABLE&quot; provided by MySQL. It is Exponentially faster in comparison to the old method: 
 
A 2.1 GB table (~2,500,000 rows) 
 
phpMyAdmin way: 
Took upwards of 28 minutes to do 
 
MySQL's Rename Table way: 
Your SQL query has been executed successfully (Query took 0.0103 sec)

        <detail>Hmm, I'm not sure if this will be the best idea that I've  
had yet, but I thought this might be useful to some  
people.  On the front page, under the 'phpMyAdmin'  
section of the table, you can include an area where it  
tells you that 'You have the latest version of  
phpMyAdmin' or 'A new version of phpMyAdmin is  
available' with a link to download the latest version.   
Though some servers have phpMyAdmin already installed  
on it, not by them, so I don't think this might be useful  
there.  Also, the phpMyAdmin website would have to  
use a textfile in order to check if it's the latest version.   
So, it's just an idea right now, but it would be nice to  
see.  :) 
 
P.S.  I love how that phpMyAdmin 2.6.0 alpha 3 has a  
really nice updated interface.  :)</detail>

        <title>Virtual Tables (Views) - ID: 880653</title>
        <detail>can we store a request as an object of the database or  
a &quot;table like&quot; so that we can use it like a table in other  
request or just to browse it ? 
 
they will appear with a different icon than table in the  
left part under the table's list but they are treated like  
read only table (no insert no update just select from  
them) 
 
or just store the request to execute them only to avoid  
to upload them from the local disk 
 
why put a little table's icon before the table if the list is  
only a list of table's name ? 
 
i'm sorry for my english, did you understand what i  
mean ?

field to display.  This presents a problem for tables

to see both the first and the last name.  This can be 
solved by either allowing one to select mulitiple 
fields for display, and then using a concat statement 
to put them together or by allowing one to choose a key 
to display.  Then if one has a key on first and last 
name, it can concat the fields (perhaps with a &quot;, &quot; 
separator.

We all know the 30 sec timeout problem. 
 
However when you insert (by hand) enough &amp;quot;INSERT&amp;quot;  
instructions that each last less than 30 seconds you  
can import files of many MB's long. 
 
 
My Feature (bug) request is to try to time your export  
routines so it devide the exported instructions to last  
less than 30 seconds. 
At this moment table dump is exported into a single  
INSERT instruction, how many rows does not matter.

display. 
 
Since I run my monitor at 1600 x 1200 and have 160+  
tables, it is much more efficient for me to have multiple  
columns in the table display, see attachment. I currently  
have 5 table row columns. The other request I put in  
requesting short labels for the actions is also helpful  
since the page is wide. 
 
Sample code is below. 
 
---------------------------

--------------------------- 
if (!$cfg['num_table_columns']) 
	$cfg['num_table_columns'] = 1; 
$num = ceil($num_tables / $cfg['num_table_columns']) 
+1; 
if($num_tables &amp;gt; $num) 
	if(($row_count % ($num)) == 0) { 
		$bgcolor       = $cfg['BgcolorTwo']; 
		$row_count = 1;

It shouldnt be too hard to put pages on the table list

1,000 tables per page by default would mean that the

want to have different indexes. Again I have to copy  
the query, delete the table and create it manually

        <detail>hi 
 
what I really miss are vertical field descriptions, especially in the usual 'browse' mode. 
 
most of my values are (short) numbers and therefore the column widths are determined by their names. the 
result is wide screens resp. many sheets of paper with lots of empty space: very hard to read sometimes. 
 
my suggestions: 
o  how about an option to put a &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; (or something like that - html? never been there....) after each letter of the field name? 
o  or to rotate them 90 deg.? 
o  or be able to choose the (very small :-) font size?

        <detail>In Advanced authentication I would like to forbid some 
users to log (basicly the root user), and optionally to

for now I have a very simple, but quite good I think 
realization - 
 
in config.inc.php file I have added for example 
 
$cfgServers[1]['forbid']['root'] = 
'|xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx||yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy|'; 
 
where root is the forbidden user and 
'|xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx||yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy|' is a list of IPs 
which are acceptable 
 
I hope you understand what I mean :)) I will work on 
making, the list a little more flexable - for example 
to make an entire network to the list. I have an idea 
about that, but no idea how is better to describe a 
network - 10.0.0.* - for example, or something else.

        <title>(Relation) Cross DB relations - ID: 551702</title>
        <detail>I've just started working with relatons within phpMyAdmin.  I'm  
going to implement the table within all my databases. 
 
One thing  
that I do is use indexes to other databases on the same server.  My  
reasoning (which may be flawed, I admit) is that I can organize by  
basic feature of my intranet via database and put details into  
individual tables. 
 
For instance, I'm working on an IT database  
for managing everything to do with all the computers in our  
facility.  One column in the main computer table is a link to the  
employees table, indicating who the primary user of that machine  
is.  Of course, the employees table is in the HR database, and not the  
IT database.  So being able to do referential checks is not currently  
possible (as far as I can find so far) within the current  
implementation.

        <detail>The ability to filter the table list that shows when you click on the &quot;Structure&quot; tab of any database. 
 
Therefore you might only want to show the list of tables with the prefix of &quot;test_&quot; in their table names. 
 
This would make maintaining databases with a huge amount of tables much more manageable. 
 
To achive this you could add a filter text input field at the bottom of the page where you could enter a filter such as test_*  to display tables starting with test_, or 
*test*  to display table with the word 'test' located anywhere in the name.

        <title>Comfortable editing of serialize()'d data - ID: 3141687</title>
        <detail>When storing objects into it's database, the CMS Drupal first stores each value for which a column exists into the corresponding column and uses the serialize() function to store the remaining ones into a single, additional LONGTEXT column. (I expect other frameworks to behave similarly.) 
 
Editing such a field by hand is quite painful, as one has to keep track of character counts, syntax, etc. I'd appreciate having a more comfortable way to edit them. 
 
I wrote a Javascript to demonstrate what I'm thinking of and tested it in both FF 3.5 and Chromium. I guess a PHP-only implementation would be more robust, since it can use PHP's native serialize() implementation. Also, my current version does not allow insertion/deletion of fields. I'll attach it as-is (needs to be included into tbl_change.php) and as a patch against Commit da6cf1b878401b3f509c9294d46864b0d6bd82dd. To test it, edit a row which contains a longtext field which contains JSON or serialize()'d data. A link &quot;Edit serialized data&quot; should appear below the textfield, opening a JQuery-dialog field when clicked upon.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.5.1) Too easy to delete source table when copying - ID: 734985</title>
        <detail>I discovered all this because I have a live database 
and a beta database and I use the copy table feature to 
&amp;quot;synch&amp;quot; the tables once in a while. 
 
When copying a table with &amp;quot;Add 'drop table' &amp;quot; it is 
very easy to wipe out the table if you are trying to 
copy the table to a different database with the same 
table name. If you forget to change the database you 
will wipe out the table and then get an error when it 
tries to do the inserting. 
 
An easy fix would be to both force the selection of the 
database as well as double check before performing the 
drop table to make sure you aren't trying to copy to 
the same table in the same DB. 
 
Another good option would be to have a choice when 
copying &amp;quot;Data Only&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Structure and data&amp;quot; that would 
allow you to empty the target table first. 
 
This was on MySQL 3.23.38 with PMA 2.5.0-rc2 
 
I know it was my own fault, but it would be nice to 
have the software protect me from being stupid.</detail>

Imprevement could be to warn the user that this taking a long time and might possible result in no results at all, do you want to start viewing from record #158.300?

        <title>(in 2.7.0) Limit length for username in privileges - ID: 1178071</title>
        <detail>Since a MySQL username is limited to 16 characters in 
length, it would be useful if the username fields in 
the privilege forms had a &quot;length&quot; attribute that 
limited the input to 16 characters as well.  This would 
prevent the dreaded Error #1145 - The host or user 
argument to GRANT is too long. 
 
Also, there should be a link to Add a new privilege on 
the initial privilege page that shows the list of links 
A-Z so that you don't have to first click on a link and 
then scroll to the Add link at the bottom.

        <title>Configurable columns in PDF schema - ID: 1547312</title>
        <detail>Good day, 
I am using phpMyAdmin 2.9.0 beta 1 and am noticing an 
issue when creating PDF documents. This issue I have 
noticed in several of the latest versions as well.  
Is there a way to select what columns you wish to have 
in the table list layout in the PDF. 
With the current column layout, some columns have 
nothing in them and their width remains wide, whereas 
some other columns could stand to go wider, ie the 
Field column. 
My main concern is some fields have rather long names 
and overlap onto the Type column in the PDF output. 
 
I have attached a sample PDF document that exhibits the 
problem listed. 
 
Thanks

(maybe except for the pages on the left frame, perhaps  
every other page if possible) that tells when the page  
was loaded.  You can have this and a refresh link next  
to it.  Perhaps in the configuration file you can set what  
certain PHP date() settings are called (such as  
Ymd:h:i:s, etc), and as well as a way to convert to a  
certain time zone.  That would be really neat.  :)</detail>

        <title>Server name badly positioned in browser title - ID: 3098200</title>
        <detail>Currently, phpMyAdmin displays the title in the format: 
 
  webhost / mysqlserver | phpMyAdmin version 
 
Most users are, I imagine, more concerned about which mysql server they are operating on, than which webhost they are connected to. For users with more than a small number of tabs open, the default behaviour leads to this vital information being truncated. 
 
For example, if phpmyadmin is running at www.example.com and I have three servers, mysql1.example.com, mysql2.example.com and mysql3.example.com my three tabs will all display www.example.... rather than the more useful mysql1, mysql2 and mysql3. 
 
The only time I can see this being a disadvantage would be for users connecting to localhost. In those circumstances, it should be trivial to display in the current format, so even localhost connections show the correct server name.</detail>

        <title>Use the user_info table to store additional user information - ID: 2932949</title>
        <detail>The mysql database comes with a table called user_info, which is supposed to be used to store additional user information such as Fullname, Contact_information, Email, Description and Icon. All of which are very useful, especially when you need to create generic accounts for other applications or if you need to log user activity or send mass notices to users using scripts. 
 
There is currently no way (other than to code your own interface) to easily see and manage this data using PHPMyAdmin. 
 
I would like for those additional fields to be shown in the user management module (Privileges), and in the forms used to create and edit users.

Thanks for a very good piece of software. I'm running

Here's my suggestion: 
 
I would like to see another &quot;Exit&quot; button, e.g. &quot;Logout 
All&quot; which logs one out from *all* servers that one is 
logged in to, not just the current one. 
 
If, for example, you log in to server 1, then choose  
server 2 in the dropdown menu, and log on to server 2, 
and then click on the &quot;Exit&quot; button (&quot;Logout&quot; link), 
you get logged out of server 2, but remain logged in to 
server 1. 
 
Thanks in advance!

This font-size attribute should be set in the themes to 
prevent the browsers from overriding the developer's

the previous versions, but I could not understand why 
the font-size attribute would be removed in this 
version. Please include it in any future versions.</detail>

        <title>(Duplicate to #638039) Multicolumn Relationships - ID: 703794</title>
        <detail>Currently relationships are single column. 
 
In practice relationships are multi-column. 
 
This should be a part of the phpMyAdmin interface. 
 
It is very annoying to be forced into having an  
autogenerated single key unique id for each  
element that is related to something else. 
 
The whole point of relational data is that it is  
related across keys however it is related, whether it  
be between apples and apples or oranges and  
oranges or whether it's between fruits and  
vegetables. 
 
The relationship is supposed to be the data. Not an  
artifact. 
 
Thanks much!!! :) :) :) :)

        <title>Log out should be a button - ID: 945440</title>
        <detail>I know I may have some trouble pushing this request through with  
all the Linux-heads and otherwise intensely computer-oriented  
folks who maintain phpMyAdmin, and who have no trouble with  
computerese, but from a standpoint of being friendly to the non- 
techie user, I propose that &quot;Login&quot;, when it means &quot;Identify  
yourself with a user name and password&quot;, should be written &quot;Log  
In&quot;, with a space. 
 
For some opinions on this topic, search Google for the following: 
+login +&quot;log in&quot; +noun +verb 
 
http://www.google.com/search? 
q=%2Blogin+%2B%22log+in%22+%2Bnoun+%2Bverb 
 
There is some particularly useful discussion here: 
 
http://www.raycomm.com/techwhirl/archives/9411/techwhirl-9411 
-00061.html 
 
I agree with those who claim that &quot;log in&quot; is an action, as in  
&quot;please log in&quot;, or as in the label of the button you push to log in  
(&quot;Log In&quot;); and that &quot;login&quot; is a noun, as in &quot;please enter your login  
and password&quot;, or an adjective, as in &quot;the login page&quot;. 
 
I mention this at this point in time because phpMyAdmin now has a  
Log Out link, which is written &quot;Log out&quot;, with a space, but retains  
&quot;Login&quot; on the login page, and this is inconsistent. 
 
Also inconsistent is that the &quot;Log out&quot; link is a link, but the Login  
button is a button. I propose that they should both be buttons. This  
is less-important to me, though, than the wording of the &quot;Log In&quot;  
button. 
 
If the &quot;Log Out&quot; link is changed to a button, it may look out-of- 
place, having a button directly next to a link (the &quot;Home&quot; link).  
Does it make sense then to maybe add a new line to the top of the  
left frame, something along the lines of &quot;Logged in as [username]  
[[Log Out]]&quot; where [[Log Out]] is a button? That may make it clear  
what it is that you're logging out of.</detail>

        <detail>Hi there. 
 
What do you think about this little improvement (I modified the code myself): When displaying all tables with db_structure.php the column size could be configurable: e.g. I prefer that there is only one unit size : Mb=Megabytes. Also an good improvement could be the possiblity to sort the columns. I can sort by number of entries, or by size or by engine type or name. 
 
Thanks

        <title>open certain queries to external (public) - ID: 1515739</title>
        <detail>the print-view of an sqlquery is a very nice feature if 
you want to export some data of a database into a good 
readeable html-table without any disturbing links 
around it. 
 
it would be nice to be able to make this page open to 
public for certain sqlqueries. 
 
a simple solution would be to have a code in the 
querystring, that allows you to see that page without 
logging in with the right database-username and -password. 
 
the code can be an MD5-coded string of the sqlquery 
plus the database username and password. 
 
this way noone can misuse that function from outside. 
 
if this md5string is in the querystring, then the 
pma-authentification script doesent check if the user 
is allowed to access the database, but instead it 
checks if the sqlquery in the querystring together with 
the right password for the selected database give the 
same md5-string</detail>

The links in phpMyAdmin is pointing to  
MySQL's &amp;quot;Searchable, with user comments&amp;quot; manual pages  
which is not easibly downloadable. 
 
Would it be possible to use the &amp;quot;HTML, one page per  
chapter&amp;quot; pages instead? They are easy to download in a  
tar-ball. 
 
Maybe have a $cfgManualBaseLong setting that you could  
point to your local manual copies, and a  
$cfgUseManualBaseShort = TRUE/FALSE to select the  
short or long pages?

        <title>(ok 3.4) Show inserted UUID - ID: 2823707</title>
        <detail>When inserting a row containing an AUTO_INCREMENT column, the value of the LAST_INSERT_ID() is shown. 
 
PMA mimics the AUTO_INCREMENT functionality on tables whose primary key is CHAR(36), by inserting UUID() into the column. 
 
INSERT INTO `test`.`foo` ( `foo_uuid` , `foo_data` ) VALUES ( UUID( ) ,'123' ); 
 
This doesn't show the value that was inserted.  Since this is the primary key, we may have no other way to identify this row, and we may need it to maintain foreign keys, etc. 
 
One way to achieve this would be for PMA to generate a UUID() internally and then insert a literal string. e.g. 
 
SELECT UUID();  /* returns '3bd208f2-c54a-102c-bd9f-d5b50e269472' */ 
 
INSERT INTO `test`.`foo` ( `foo_uuid` , `foo_data` ) VALUES ('3bd208f2-c54a-102c-bd9f-d5b50e269472' ,'123' );</detail>

        <title>(Dump) Allow schema dumps to separate files - ID: 539020</title>
        <detail>When doing a database schema dump to a file (or zipped  
file), it would be helpful to have the ability to  
retrieve the files on a one-file-per-table basis.   
This would help break up the data into more manageable  
sizes, and confer the following advantages: 
 
- Since these dumps serve as a good way to backup /  
restore databases, it helps organize the backups. 
- Really large files may not upload within the  
standard 30-second PHP page timeout, so breaking it  
down this way would be helpful. 
 
Of course, if the system is generating multiple files  
for the dump, it will need to zip them all up so that  
it can be retrieved as one download by the user. 
 
Thanks for writing such a great product.  It's been my  
standard against which all other PHP applications are  
judged.

        <title>(ok 2.9.0) Charset names slightly different in IBM AIX iconv - ID: 1399406</title>
        <detail>Hi! 
 
Under IBM AIX, using the IBM supplied iconv library 
instead of the GNU iconv library, names of character 
encodings / character sets / code sets are slightly 
different; e.g. &quot;iso-8859-1&quot; is called &quot;ISO8859-1&quot;. 
 
Would it be possible to have a &quot;translation&quot; of 
character  encoding names, as this most probably 
affects iconv() conversions between e.g. iso-8859-1 and 
UTF-8? 
 
See the following support request, for MRBS (Meeting 
Room Booking System) submitted by me: 
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1396789&amp;group_id=5113&amp;atid=105113 
 
And the attachment: 
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=5113&amp;atid=105113&amp;file_id=162254&amp;aid=1396789 
 
 
The parts to &quot;borrow&quot; from my suggested changes would 
be the $gnu_iconv_to_aix_iconv_codepage_map and the 
get_aix_character_encoding() function, and in the case 
of  conversions to/from UTF-8, the $aix_utf8_converters 
array to ensure that a conversion is possible. 
 
References to IBM documentation is supplied in the 
comments accompanying those functions/arrays. 
 
Many thanks in advance!

the right one. 
 
It would be nice if the database dropdown could be 
customized that it only shows the most recently used 
databases on top, or that a user can &quot;bookmark&quot; his 
often used databases.

        <title>displaying hostname on titlebar - ID: 919383</title>
        <detail>i usually have one installation of phpmyadmin on every  
server i manage. when i play with more db at a time, the  
browser window title help me in the switching beetwen  
them. 
 
unfortunately, all of the titlebar windows are reporting  
the same information.  
I mean, it displays: db.table in execution on localhost. 
so if you have 3 or more, it's a pain to switch to the  
desired window at once. because i have to look in the  
address bar of each window. 
 
i advice you to add the hostname on the titlebar. 
 
i.e.: [servername] db.table in execution on localhost.

Also the table select box in export view is to small. 6 rows are not well arranged when you have about 80 tables in the database. Just remove all the  between the radiobuttons and there will be enough room for 10 or 12 lines.</detail>

a BUTTLOAD of time in my job. Many thanks.  
 
Using the bookmark feature, I have an idea that you  
all may have already thought of.  
Re: the &amp;quot;bookmarked sql-query&amp;quot; dropdown box,  
would it be possible to put a text box next to it, and  
have a variable in the query that can be expanded  
according to what's in the box?  
 
example:  
bookmarked query:  
 
select name,extra_1 from product where name like  
&amp;quot;%{variable here}%&amp;quot;  
 
textbox: [value for variable here]  
 
my knowledge of php is minimal, and my time is even  
more minimal. It may be something one of you wizzes  
could do in a second.  
 
thanks again, and much success to you all.

        <title>(ok 3.3) Diff between two tables/databases - ID: 631976</title>
        <detail>From Eric Persson: 
---------------------------- 
Hi everyone, 
 
Some of you might remember I asked for a structure diff 
earlier, I want to compare 2 tables and get an alter 
query which would make the target table to look exactly 
like the original table. 
 
I have now made a small hack which almost does this, at 
least it show the idea of what I want it to be. 
 
I added the file diff_tables.php which currently takes 
?db as an get argument. It shows the table in that 
database and you can pick 2 tables to compare and you 
get a hopefully working alter query. :) 
 
I modified left.php to show a link after the 
num_tables, like (diff) which goes to diff_tables.php 
with ?db as the database. 
 
If you want to try it out, patch your 2.3.2 version of 
phpmyadmin with the files, or visit 
http://www.egp.cx/phpMyAdmin-2.3.2/ where I put up a 
patched version. Please dont destroy the tables to much. :) 
 
Some ideas of what to improve: 
 * maintain the order of the fields 
 * maintain keys/indexes and auto_increment fields 
 * make it possible to diff tables between databases 
 * make it possible to diff create table queries 
 * create a nice graphical view over whats 
added/changed/dropped 
 
Do you have any furhter suggestions? 
 
Please comment and try it out and think about it. The 
code is still very hacky, and I might have re-invented 
the wheel in some places, but I'm not yet familiar with 
all libraryfiles etc. 
 
Best regards, 
    Eric</detail>

With `cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0` it loads the login page, but when I click &quot;Go&quot; the page redirects to: 
 
    http://www.mydomain.com/index.php?token=B5G0b509eaS8936C7dbW898a58Kclc05 
 
Notice the directory `phpMyAdmin` is missing. If I set `cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1` then things work correctly. I would really like to ovoid setting `cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1` as this is a security issue with nginx and php.

        <title>Change the order of the fields in a table. - ID: 1553237</title>
        <detail>Hi. 
 
It is possible to change the order of the fields in a 
table without having to first delete the field and then 
create it again. 
 
So It would be nice to be able to mark a field in a 
table and then tell phpmyadmin which field you want to 
place it AFTER or eventually place it FIRST in the table. 
 
Example of how to move a field after another field: 
 
ALTER TABLE test MODIFY COLUMN ColNameToMove tinyint(3) 
UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER ColNameToMoveAfter 
 
Have tested the above and it works like a charm. 
 
The MySql specification also states that we can use 
&quot;FIRST&quot; instead of &quot;AFTER ColNameToMoveAfter&quot; to put 
the field first in the field list. 
 
It would be supercool if PHPMYADMIN could implement 
this feature. 
 
Anyway, thanks for the best MySQL Database 
Administration tool there is.</detail>

        <title>Speed up slow triggers by using EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA - ID: 2841135</title>
        <detail>STRATO hosted Server - MySQL 5.0.67-log 
I found another very slow query when pma-browsing through the structures, the last query for the triggers:  
 
 
[count] =&gt; 1  
[query] =&gt; SELECT TRIGGER_SCHEMA, TRIGGER_NAME, EVENT_MANIPULATION, ACTION_TIMING, ACTION_STATEMENT, EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA, EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE FROM information_schema.TRIGGERS WHERE TRIGGER_SCHEMA= 'mydbname' and EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE = 'mytablename';  
[time] =&gt; 5.757780790329  
[trace] =&gt; Array  
[0] =&gt; ./libraries/database_interface.lib.php#1109: PMA_DBI_try_query()  
[1] =&gt; ./libraries/database_interface.lib.php#1331: PMA_DBI_fetch_result()  
[2] =&gt; ./libraries/tbl_triggers.lib.php#14: PMA_DBI_get_triggers()  
[3] =&gt; ./tbl_structure.php#811: require()  
 
I also found the reason for the slow triggers. That was changed in pma somewhere between 3.0.0. and 3.2.1  
In pma 3.0.0. the function PMA_DBI_get_triggers() takes less than a second in the same environment. 
 
The implementation in pma 3.0.0 used  
WHERE EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA='mydbname'  
In pma 3.2.1. the query is built with   
WHERE TRIGGER_SCHEMA= 'mydbname'  
 
According to  
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/triggers-table.html  
it should be safe to use both:  
 
&quot;The TRIGGER_SCHEMA [...] contain the name of the database in which the trigger occurs [...]&quot;  
 
&quot;[...]every trigger is associated with exactly one table. The EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA and EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE columns contain the database in which this table occurs, and the table's name.&quot;   
 
So, why not use EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA instead of TRIGGER_SCHEMA? 
It seems to be much faster on at least one big hoster's servers.  
 
best regards,   
Markus

value the first element in the array, and so forth. 
 
Please include a number in the example, as it appears  
numbers need to be escaped too. 
Could you also improve the parser to remove the need  
to escape numbers and the need to remove spaces? 
 
Also, would it be possible to specify default options

        <title>(ok 3.4) Refresh-icon for left frame - ID: 1186511</title>
        <detail>I use phpMyAdmin A LOT. Really nice. One small thing (i 
think) is a refresh-icon to the left, that would 
refresh/reload the list of databases and tables. 
Everytime I have to refresh, I have to go to another 
database and back again. It is not a fault in 
phpMyAdmin because I have a script that adds tables in 
the background and they are not visible on the list. 
 
So a refresh-icon would be REALLY nice!!!!

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=377411&amp;aid=2937123&amp;group_id=23067 
 
the idea was, to have a button to show nearly all rows of a table, that can be used with the mouse. 
 
a field to type in how many rows you want to see every  time is not enough! 
 
and there is a bug anyway: 
if you type this in the field now (for ex. 50 rows) and press &quot;show&quot;, then it shows all entries starting from row 51 till 100 thats not good, the first time you press show, it should show entry 0-49</detail>

        <title>(ok 3.4) Easy Backup/Restore - ID: 2649375</title>
        <detail>This whole process should be made more intuitive.  Basically, we are talking about simple, standard database usage, and for this process to be fraught with problems makes the use of some sort of admin GUI not as usable as it should be. 
 
Image the situation as I experienced.  With decades of usage experience, I was totally a newbie in how to properly handle the export of my web site cms database from my old host to the import on my new host.  There are issues that may have to do with passwords and users, with database/table format changes, and what-have-you.  So much is unknown, and too many times the user is left to trying to figure out some cryptic error message from MySQL.  Any admin interface should have taken care of that, and yet we find that phpMyAdmin is not as intuitive as it should be. 
 
This export/import process needs to be made automated and goof-proof.  It offers too many confusing and non-basic options.  Perhaps a simple wizard would be the most useful.  The program need to be tuned up with less geek-speak, and particularly in any wizard design. 
 
That's my two cents' worth.  Thanks for the fine efforts.</detail>

Would also be great if you were able to install that

download it at a bare minimum.  The install feature  
should only be available to users of the highest access  
so that shared host/pma users cannot upgrade the  
version that they are using and disrupt the other users  
on the same host.  An idea may be to activate its use  
through the config file, or even have the installer as a  
command line script rather than through the interface.   
Then only users with shell access to pma would be able  
to upgrade it automatically.  One prerequisite for the  
installer would be that the config file settings are  
preserved.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.5.5) Not Documented: User pma is 'controluser' - ID: 819627</title>
        <detail>I'm a new user, setting up a phpMyAdmin server, and I  
didn't see anything mentioned in the documentation  
regarding WHERE to put the user information for the  
phpmyadmin database (for the PHP_* tables). 
 
Through trial and error, I figured out that it was  
controluser and controlpass even though they're  
documented in the config file as: 
 
&amp;quot;MySQL control user settings (this user must have read- 
only access to the &amp;quot;mysql/user&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;mysql/db&amp;quot; tables)&amp;quot; 
 
Now that I've set it up, and reviewed these documentation  
locations, I see that it is mentioned in passing.  As  
someone searching for a &amp;quot;OK, I've created the pma user for  
the phpmyadmin database, but where the heck do I put  
the username and password!&amp;quot; section of the  
documentation, I was completely lost. 
 
You could make it clearer in the  
&amp;quot;$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser'] string&amp;quot; and/or  
&amp;quot;$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb'] string&amp;quot; configuration  
documentation.  You could update the comment in the  
config.inc file (this user is also used for accessing &amp;lt;pmadb&amp;gt;  
used to store the PMA_ tables). 
 
You could mention it in the create_tables.sql file.  Tell the  
admin to add a user called &amp;quot;pma&amp;quot; with a random password,  
and then put &amp;quot;pma&amp;quot; and that password in the controluser/ 
controlpass settings of config.inc.</detail>

        <title>(ok 3.1) disallow root login with empty password - ID: 2072147</title>
        <detail>Hi all, 
 
At least in Debian's context, the issue of MySQL not having a root password, and installing phpMyAdmin opening that up to the world is a frequently recurring issue that people are concerned with. 
 
While I think it's people's own responsibility to correctly set MySQL's root password, this is apparently something that concerns many people. On the other hand, the cases where users really make useful use of logging on as root without a password are probably very limited. 
 
So I think the following could make sense: 
- by default, disallow logins of root without a password. 
- add a config option like 'allowRootLoginEmptyPassword' that defaults to false but that the user can decide to set to true if they require the functionality. 
 
I think it hardly hurts, and does pacify a large number of concerns over this. 
 
If such a thing would be acceptible, I'd gladly make a patch, let me know. 
 
 
thanks,

One thing about phpMyAdmin drives me mad though - it's the sql popup window. can we get rid of it? I'd rather you split the RHS panel into frames (yes, frames) than having to constantly cycles through my browser window to find out where the SQL query has disappeared to. 
 
Ideally though, the SQL query box would appear / disappear gracefully with DHTML, like what happens when you click on the triangle on the O2 website.

        <title>relation - add &amp;quot;display column&amp;quot; column - ID: 539186</title>
        <detail>the relation system should allow one to specify a display  
column, which would replace the column in the source table with  
data from a column in the destination table. 
 
For example, if I have &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; table and a &amp;quot;request&amp;quot; table,  
request.person_id would be related to person.id . However,  
when displaying rows from the &amp;quot;request&amp;quot; table, it would be  
much more useful to display the person's name in place of the  
request.person_id field, which would require a lookup in the  
person table. 
 
Also, this could be used to create a popup menu of choices  
when creating a (for example) &amp;quot;request&amp;quot; record -- it would show  
all the possible people's names in a listbox or a popup rather  
than making the user go figure out what the ID number for the  
desired person is first.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.7.1) Column comments - make editable / more visible - ID: 1362923</title>
        <detail>PhpMyAdmin now has basic support for column comments,  
which is very welcome: 
http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/downloads.php? 
relnotes=3 
 
However, this only extends to readability when  
listing the data dictionary (in db_datadict.php ). 
 
Given that MySQL 4.1 now supports native column  
comments, it would be very useful indeed to be able  
to add/edit these directly in MySQL. 
 
1) It would certainly be good to show them when  
listing the table properties: 
tbl_properties_structure.php 
 
2) However, more importantly, the ability to create  
the comments in the first place, in 
tbl_create.php 
 
3) and when editing column names, as in tbl_alter.php 
 
Comments seem to be very much the same as any other  
of the metadata (like NULL,Extra,Default, etc)  
associated with a column, so presumably the code need  
not be too difficult to introduce. 
 
I for one would find this an extremely useful  
addition to PhpMyAdmin.</detail>

        <title>Renaming of colums referenced as foreign keys in InnoDBs - ID: 1873610</title>
        <detail>Using InnoDB as database format, phpMyAdmin is able to handle the foreign key definitions. 
MySQL does not support renaming of columns referenced in other tables as foreign keys. 
If you try altering such columns in phpMyAdmin it throws a MySQL error like this: 
 
#1025 - Error on rename of '.\dbname\#sql-144c_ee11' to '.\dbname\tablename' (errno: 150)  
 
 
It would be possible to catch this error in two ways: 
First one is to check if the colums is referenced and forbid the user to rename the column. 
Second, of course more complicated, but more comfortable for the user: 
Read out the correspondig constrains, delete them, alter the table, recreate the constrains with new name(s).

        <title>null field values: checkbox - ID: 442855</title>
        <detail>After reading the documentation, and finding out that 
setting a field to 'null' actually sets it to null, I'm 
curious as to why that's not the default value for a 
field during an edit when the value is null.  As it 
stands now, you have to know which fields were set to 
NULL, and remember to type 'null' into those fields, or 
else they become blank.  Even worse are integer and 
datetime fields, which take on a numeric value, and the 
current date, respectively.  In my bug tracking 
database, I've accidentally &amp;quot;closed&amp;quot; numerous bugs by 
accidentally setting the resolved_date field to 
something other than null without intending to do so. 
 
Am I the only one that has trouble with this?</detail>

Well, one of those is that in the dataset edit page, fields created as &quot;BOOL&quot; (and stored as &quot;CHAR(1) BINARY&quot;) also each contain a SELECT from the database import page, listing importable files in the import directory.

        <title>Change Tracking - ID: 2476282</title>
        <detail>I think the following new feature could be an incredibly useful addition for software developers. 
 
Typically, through the course of developing an application or website, table structures undergo various changes from generation 1 to generation 2, etc. 
 
What most developers do (including phpMyAdmin developers), is they try to manually describe the differences between generation 1 and generation 2 of a table, and create upgrade scripts - typically just SQL statements that upgrade tables by ALTERing them as needed. 
 
What I would like to see, is a version management feature that could help with this. 
 
This would require a new table for tracking changes: 
 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `pma_tracking` ( 
  `db_name` varchar(64) collate utf8_bin NOT NULL, 
  `table_name` varchar(64) collate utf8_bin NOT NULL, 
  `version` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, 
  `date_created` datetime NOT NULL, 
  `date_updated` datetime NOT NULL, 
  `snapshot` text collate utf8_bin NOT NULL, 
  `create_sql` text collate utf8_bin, 
  `update_sql` text collate utf8_bin, 
  `exported` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default '0', 
  `date_exported` datetime default NULL, 
  `tracking` set('UPDATE','REPLACE','INSERT','DELETE','TRUNCATE','CREATE DATABASE','ALTER DATABASE','DROP DATABASE','CREATE TABLE','ALTER TABLE','RENAME TABLE','DROP TABLE','CREATE INDEX','DROP INDEX','CREATE VIEW','ALTER VIEW','DROP VIEW') collate utf8_bin default NULL, 
  PRIMARY KEY  (`db_name`,`table_name`,`version`) 
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT; 
 
It could work something like this: 
 
On the &quot;Structure&quot; tab, at the bottom (next to &quot;Print view&quot;, &quot;Relation view&quot;, etc.) - add a new button: &quot;Track Changes&quot;. 
 
This takes you to a page with an overview of all recorded versions of the table - this is initially empty, so to create &quot;version 1&quot;, you have to click on a &quot;Create Version 1&quot; button. 
 
(the Track Changes page has a dropdown that enables you to switch to other tables - color coding of the table names indicates whether tracking information exists, and wether tracking is active) 
 
The current table structure is inserted into the pma_tracking table with `version`=1 and `create_sql` filled with a complete CREATE TABLE statement. The results of SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM and SHOW INDEX FROM is stored as a serialized array in the `snapshot` column. 
 
Now, before you start making changes and developing version 2 of your table, you click on the &quot;Create Version 2&quot; button on the tracking page. A form appears, with options to decide which statements you wish to record for version 2: 
 
  &quot;Record Version 2 of `database`.`table`&quot; 
 
    [ ] Record Data Manipulation Queries: 
        [ ] UPDATE 
        [ ] REPLACE 
        [ ] INSERT 
        [ ] DELETE 
        [ ] TRUNCATE 
 
    [x] Record Data Definition Queries: 
 
        [x] Database: 
            [x] ALTER DATABASE 
            [x] DROP DATABASE 
 
        [x] Tables: 
            [x] CREATE TABLE 
            [x] ALTER TABLE 
            [x] RENAME TABLE 
            [x] DROP TABLE 
 
        [x] Indexes: 
            [x] CREATE INDEX 
            [x] DROP INDEX 
 
        [x] Views: 
            [x] CREATE VIEW 
            [x] ALTER VIEW 
            [x] DROP VIEW 
 
Upon starting version 2 (and later versions), the record is created right away. 
 
The `snapshot` column is populated, and compared to that of the previous version - if any untracked changes to columns or indexes are detected, ADD/ALTER/DROP COLUMN and ADD/ALTER/DROP INDEX queries are generated and added to the `update_sql` column of the new tracking record, along with a comment stating why and when these queries were generated. 
 
The user is returned to the Structure view of the table. 
 
Change tracking is now enabled, and queries of the selected types are recorded into the `update_sql` column. 
 
While tracking is enabled, a notice appears on every page related to the tracked table, indicating that recording is on - and a link to turn off change tracking is displayed. 
 
Once the user has completed the changes, tracking can be turned off, and you can return to the Change Tracking page to compile and export tracked changes. 
 
When no tables are currently being tracked, the Change Tracking page will display a link (otherwise a notice), allowing the user to go to the &quot;Compile And Export&quot; form. The `exported` field in a tracking record indicates whether tracked changes have been compiled and exported yet. 
 
On the compile and export form, you check off the tables (or whole database/s) for which you wish to compile and export changes. By default, all tables with changes that have not yet been exported, will be checked. You also have dropdowns to manually set the &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; version numbers for each table - these are set by default to the last exported version (from), and the latest newer version (to). 
 
You have two buttons to submit this form: &quot;Export&quot; and &quot;Preview&quot; - in preview mode, no changes to version records are made; otherwise, exported tracking records are flagged as `exported`. Initially, the &quot;Export&quot; button is disabled, forcing the user to always preview at least once, before flagging changes as exported, and a confirmation dialog is displayed when you hit &quot;Export&quot; - this ensures that you don't accidentally flag your changes prematurely. 
 
The output consists of two SQL scripts (displayed in two textareas). 
 
1. The upgrade script, which consists of all the `update_sql` statements of the relevant change records, compiled into one, with comments inserted to indicate where tables and versions begin. Upgrade scripts will contain a warning-comment at the top, telling you to backup your tables before attempting an upgrade. 
 
2. The install script, which consists of all the `create_sql` statements from the latest version of each table's change records, compiled into one, with comments indicating where tables begin, and what version number was exported. Install scripts for any tables with `version` &gt; 1, will contain a warning-comment at the top, telling you that any existing tables from a previous version will be dropped on install. 
 
An advanced user who needs to recover from accidental flagging, can use the `date_*` columns to determine which records to unflag - `date_created` is set when a change record is initially created, and `date_updated` is set whenever a query is appended to the `update_sql` field. The `date_exported` field is set to the exact same date and time for all exported changes, meaning you can also SELECT and/or GROUP BY on this field, to see which changes were part of the same operation. 
 
At it's simplest, this system can be used to create upgrade scripts, by simply adding a new version before and after table structures are altered. 
 
Better still, by recording your changes, you can take into account UPDATEs, temporary tables, etc., which may be required to convert from one version of a table structure to another.</detail>

        <detail>I'd like phpmyadmin to have the ability for me to select two different DBS on 2 different connections and have phpmyadmin scan both and diplay a split 'source db' and 'target db' view of both with tables, fieldnames and types listed and the differences. highlighted. In that view I'd like a widget with a list of auto-generated or ordered structure-sync, type-sync and data-sync queries which I can select/deselect in a column of checkboxes and then execute the selected ones via a button in order to sync the DB parts I'd like to sync. ... I find this the most usefull feature of the closed source tool Navicat over phpmyadmin. However, their Linux version is a disgrace and I'd appreciate this feature as an attractive addition to phpmyadmin. 
Sidenote: 
I'm a professional PHP Developer and have no time to join phpmyadmin but I'm willing to support any core developer who want's to implement this feature as a personal assistant code-monkey. I can help plan the feature in detail or help code functions for DB analysis or testing of implementations of comparsion algorithyms or such.

        <title>Number of fields on the structure page - ID: 2790004</title>
        <detail>Tables may have a huge number of fields. This information is sometimes quite useful and there's no way to easily find it right now. 
Changes to improve that point are quite easy and they could be implemented in juste a few minutes with the use of the already existing $fields_cnt variable. 
 
Here are my proposals : 
- display this number in the header of the table structure between parenthesis. Ex : Fields (42) 
in tbl_structure.php : &quot;&gt; 
 
- or/and display this count number in the statistics table, at the bottom of the page</detail>

        <title>Option to disable print dialog on print preview - ID: 1460870</title>
        <detail>In phpMyAdmin 2.7.0-pl2 when I click on the print view 
buttons at the bottom of a table browse page, I get 
printview alright, but I'd like more control over the 
presentation.  First, I'd like the pop-up printer 
dialog to be optional.  Next I'd like to eliminate or 
contol the LIMIT on the number of records.  In small 
tables, for example, I'd just like to see the whole 
table displayed. Ideally there would be some controls 
on the table browser page but php configuration 
variables would be ok.  Thanks.</detail>

which executes every method a 1000 times an returns you

        <title>Show suggested solutions when can't connect - ID: 886779</title>
        <detail>I just went through some problems getting PMA set up. Basically it  
amounted to not having the PMA user set up properly in MySQL. 
 
What I'd like to see is when pma@localhost (or whatever) can't  
connect is a brief page of suggested actions. For instance: 
 
  Couldn't connect to get server information. 
  You may need to: 
    Set the PMA password (SET PASSWORD FOR pma@localhost = ...) 
  or 
    Grant privileges to the PMA user: 
      [SQL for granting access] 
 
  Either action will require accessing the MySQL server directly with  
high enough permissions. 
 
This way I can just copy and paste the suggested information and  
send it directly to the server. 
 
Thanks,

        <title>7-zip download archives and BitTorrent - ID: 1351277</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
I am wondering if the phpMyAdmin downloads on 
sourceforge will offer .7z archives in addition to the 
current .zip, .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 archives. 
 
The size of phpMyAdmin-2.7.0-beta1.7z is 1477 kB, 
compared to the 1877 kB of 
phpMyAdmin-2.7.0-beta1.tar.bz2 a saving of 21 percent 
(solid, Ultra): 
http://7-zip.org/ 
 
Bandwidth is expensive, and there are new standards to 
save it like 7-zip and BitTorrent. 
By the way, PostgreSQL offers most downloads as 
.torrents, too: 
http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/v8.1.0/ 
 
 
Keep up the good work,

        <title>Schema Description Metadata - ID: 2095553</title>
        <detail>I thought, since any good piece of software has comments, permit people to associate descriptive information with their schema to help others navigate the database schema.  
 
This would just be an option of phpmyadmin that would be offered as a flag in the configuration area, and would say load and access a table with the description information, per column, per table, with a description blob. Accessible as a popup note when rolling over a &quot;small note&quot; icon in the tables.  
 
I figured this would be useful when one adds columns into tables at a later date and needs a refresher to determine why the column or table was added.  
 
When SQL is dumped, the descriptions will be embedded in the SQL as comments.</detail>

        <title>Going down in PK &gt;&gt; FK hierarchy - ID: 2977279</title>
        <detail>With pmadb database configured, phpMyAdmin supports &quot;going-up&quot;, &quot;FK &gt;&gt; PK&quot; in Browse mode. 
Values in every Foreign Key column are links for viewing the record with corresponding Primary Key. 
 
The suggestion is to realize also going in reverse direction - &quot;down&quot; in this hierarchy. 
If the table contains PK constraints, let's add new icon near &quot;pen&quot; (b_edit.png) to every record &amp; to the bottom of the Browse page. 
If the table contains only one PK, this new icon should be a link to Browse page with FK-table filtered by clicked PK. 
To browse FK-rows attached to a group of PKs, user may mark rows with that PKs &amp; click icon at the bottom of the page. 
Otherwise (the table contains several PKs) let's add a little menu dropping-down from new icon on hover or on click. 
So user can click icon &amp; select which FK-table to browse.</detail>

But if you add a field of that type, then edit it to make it unsigned, it works. It also lets you create a new field as TINYINT(1) set as unsigned. 
 
This isn't really a bug with phpmyadmin, as the problem lies with the MySQL parser being fussy. I know BOOL is an alias to TINYINT(1) so I could make my fields that way, but perhaps other people wouldn't know that and then go on to use an inappropriate datatype instead to get rid of the error. So from a usability point of view a nice feature would be to translate the aliases before sending them to the MySQL parser, thus allowing phpmyadmin users to create an unsigned BOOL field without an error.

        <detail>most developers used to do: 
1. test on devel sql sever 
2. update production sql server 
they switch between these 2 servers frequentlly 
e.g.: 
when i'm in devel:db1.table1 i'd like to switch to  
production:db1.table1 as soon as possible. 
 
so i'd suggest phpmyadmin add the following configs: 
devel server: 
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['server_key'] = 'devel'; 
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['relative_severs'] = array( 
'production' =&amp;gt; 'production server' 
); 
 
production:

        <title>Authentication: don't give stduser access to encrypted passw - ID: 450246</title>
        <detail>The MySQL docs here: 
 
http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql/bychapter/manu 
al_Privilege_system.html 
warn extensively about giving accounts access to the  
MySQL USER table.  A few examples: 
 
  &amp;quot;DON'T EVER GIVE ANYONE (EXCEPT THE MySQL ROOT USER)  
ACCESS TO THE user TABLE IN THE MySQL DATABASE! The  
encrypted password is the real password in MySQL. If  
you know the password listed in the user table for a  
given user, you can easily log in as that user if you  
have access to the host listed for that account.&amp;quot; 
 
and  
 
  &amp;quot;Note that even if the password is  
stored 'scrambled', and knowing your 'scrambled'  
password is enough to be able to connect to the MySQL  
server!&amp;quot; 
 
and  
 
  &amp;quot;Never give a normal user access to the mysql.user  
table. Knowing the encrypted password for a user makes  
it possible to login as this user.&amp;quot; 
 
 
This of course means the way that phpMyAdmin uses the  
stduser account is bad... 
 
I tried getting around this by only granting stduser  
access to specific columns in the USER table, but then  
MySQL complains when line 268 of lib.inc.php tries to  
validate users manually by looking up usernames and  
passwords in the USER table.  Wouldn't it be better to  
let MySQL do the validation by issuing  
a &amp;quot;mysql_connect&amp;quot; command with the supplied  
credentials? 
 
If that makes sense, then perhaps the docs could be  
updated to specify the exact columns that stduser  
needs access to in the user table in order to be  
really safe. 
 
thanks,

        <title>Authentication: always prompt, no stduser - ID: 447630</title>
        <detail>I would like to request a third authentication method  
for phpMyAdmin, sort of a mix between Basic and  
Advanced modes. 
 
This new method would prompt the user for a  
username/password (like Advanced mode) but otherwise  
behave exactly as Basic mode.  In other words, it  
would just try to connect as though it got the  
username/password from config.inc.php.  It would *not*  
need a stduser account like Advanced mode does. 
 
The benefits: 
* This allows users who do not have the privs to  
create a stduser account for Advanced mode to still  
have some of the advantages of Advanced mode: 
  - no need to enter username/password in  
config.inc.php 
  - multiple people can use the product 
 
* This also provides better security when connecting  
to multiple servers.  For instance, I currently have  
the need to connect to one server via Advanced mode  
and another via Basic (because I don't have perms to  
create the stduser on the second database).  With the  
current setup it is not safe to do that because  
Advanced mode does not work with an .htaccess file,  
and that means the Basic database is not protected in  
any way (i.e. anyone who knows the correct URL can  
administer the Basic database without being  
authenticated)</detail>

        <detail>When I set column level priveleges for MySQL, I can't use

Why?  Because, MySQL does not allow you to &amp;quot;SELECT *&amp;quot;

        <title>Mass-convert table engines? - ID: 1048083</title>
        <detail>We have hundreds of databases each with dozens of tables -- the  
major projects with hundreds of tables. We would like to migrate  
these from ISAM and MyISAM to InnoDB. The PMA interface isn't  
designed for this -- to change a table's engine, you have to go to  
the Properties view, then click the Operations tab, then scroll  
down, then select InnoDB, then click the submit button, and then  
repeat that for each table. I'm not sure what the better interface  
would be, but would there be a way to get an interface into PMA  
whereby you could select a group of tables and then convert these  
to a different engine all at once? For example, by adding an option  
to the select menu at the bottom of the table list. 
 
Conversion to InnoDB can fail. (Certain kinds of indexes and keys  
aren't supported by InnoDB.) Probably similar issues with other  
engines. So there would need to be some good error handling,  
reporting of errors for failed conversions, and it shouldn't just  
break off there, it should continue converting the remaining tables  
and report all encountered errors at once.</detail>

        <title>Resultset Size Tolerance - ID: 753073</title>
        <detail>It would be nice if you could specify a tolerance on the  
number of records returned while browsing through the  
records in a table. 
 
Say for instance that you have 31 records.  The default  
page size is set to 30.  This means you have a second  
page with only one record on it.  If it were possible to  
set a tolerance of say 5 records, then this would display  
30 records on a page only if the sum of the records on  
this page and the next one was greater than the page  
size plus the tolerance. 
 
Example: 
 
Page 1: 30 records 
Page 2: 30 records 
Page 3: 2 records 
 
Page Size = 30 records 
Tolerance = 5 records 
 
While viewing page 1, you would only see 30 records as  
the size of page 1 + size of page 2 = 60 which is greater  
than page size + tolerance. 
 
While viewing Page 2 would would see the records from  
both Page 2 and Page 3 displayed because the sum of  
the records is only 32 which is less than the tolerance  
level of 35. 
 
This means that for the above example, there would only  
be 2 pages of information to page through instead of 3. 
 
The only reason that I ask this is that often I have  
slightly over one page of records to display and as it  
always defaults to 30, I either have to go through the  
pages or I have to adjust the page size all the time. 
 
I think that this would increase the usability of the  
system while browsing through recordsets.</detail>

        <title>Support for editing binary fields in hexadecimal - ID: 1611770</title>
        <detail>tbl_change.php currently contains the following note: 
// We don't want binary data to be destroyed 
// Note: from the MySQL manual: &quot;BINARY doesn't affect how the column is 
//       stored or retrieved&quot; so it does not mean that the contents is 
//       binary 
 
The problem is that binary fields are byte arrays rather than strings. Using binary fields instead of textual fields is a bad practicle because there is high chance that the data will be displayed incorrectly or data loss will occur. 
 
There is no problem for SBCS (single byte character set) encodings because the byte-to-character mapping is a 1-to-1 mapping. MBCS (multi byte character set) encodings on the other hand can map some characters to a byte squence longer than one byte. The data loss can occur (at a very high probability with MBCS encodings) because proper decoder implementations has to filter out invalid byte sequences and when the data is converted back to a byte array, these invalid byte sequences are lost. 
 
I usually use binary fields to store password hashes and small image files. 
 
This problem not only affects East Asian languages but UTF-8 as well. And because UTF-8 is widely used by now some solution is necessary. 
 
A very obvious solution is to modify the user interface to edit binary fields in hexadecimal. 
 
Note that phpMyAdmin already has support for exoprting binary fields in hexadecimal and that is the default settings. 
 
I believe that binary fields are intended to store binary (non-textual) data and as such they are better to be edited in hexadecimal. 
 
I suggest to make this behavior default. 
 
And this would render $cfg['ProtectBinary'] unnecessary so removing $cfg['ProtectBinary'] should be considered as well.</detail>

MyCustomer@myserver.com) instead of host names

Not really necessary, but still a 'nice-to-have', and pretty  
easy to implement: 
 
Set a variable $cfg['Servers'][$i]['_name'] in your  
config.inc.php. 
 
Edit your main.php around line 130: 
 if (!empty($val['_name'])) { 
                echo $val['_name']; 
 }  
 
... and it shows a 'readable' name instead of  
multiple 'db0814.myserver.com, db999.myserver.com'  
and so on...</detail>

        <detail>During data entry, it is a frequent operation to create a row that is very similar to an existing row. 
 
I would like a &quot;create copy of row&quot; function, which would work like a combination of &quot;insert row&quot; and &quot;edit row&quot;. 
 
On a result set, there are edit/delete icons.  I would add a third icon for &quot;create copy&quot;.  This would redirect  to the insert-record screen (same as clicking on insert-new-row), but the values in the form would be pre-filled with the values from the current row. 
 
Obviously, the user would need to edit values to satisfy unique-constraints, etc. before saving. 
 
At present, to achieve this, it is necessary to have two PMA windows open, and copy/paste each value.</detail>

        <detail>Nowadays best standard charset for international usage

So, it would be great if phpmyadmin would have the

like the option Notepad++ has.  
So view as UTF-8 (default) or ANSI 
Now phpmyadmin forces this in html headers. 
 
For table data input fields I would like to have the same  
option. So enter the data in e.g. ANSI or latin1, but store  
in the database fields using the collation setting. 
 
For example we enter in Ansi   
 Sant nderung

        <title>Export Data to Insert without Primary Key - ID: 1229896</title>
        <detail>I ran across a situation where I needed to export a 
table in SQL and add it into another database with the 
same table structure but I wanted to add these elements 
onto the end of the the table elements.  The problem 
was that the export also put in the primary keys into 
the insert statements and that made me have to write a 
quick script to export this data without the primary 
key in the insert and do this for myself.  This would 
be a great addition to the export. 
 
Note: I would write this myself for you guys, but I am 
at work and my management do not want me to write open 
source code on the job.  If I get a chance this week in 
some spare time I will put together a patch, but no 
guarantees.</detail>

        <detail>Hello! 
 
phpMyAdmin 2.2.3, Netscape 4.77 (or IE 5.5) 
Whn I make browse to table and choose some row for  
editing then after submiting data browser will show  
contents of table again. This is very good, but it  
works only if to look first $cfgMaxRows records. If to  
choose next page or to make some query then after  
finishing editing the browser returns page with  
properties of table. So if $cfgMaxRows is 50 then to  
edit step by step records 51, 52, 53.... you need to  
make several extra clicks (Browse--&amp;gt;next page) 
 
Maybe it's possible to add in editing window  
choices &amp;quot;do'nt save changes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;continiue editing  
with next record&amp;quot;.... 
 
Another thing. Is it possible to get rid of function  
cell in editing table. If I had 20 fields then it is  
quite boring to press 39 times [tab] key or eaven  
worse to point 20 times with mouse. This shold be user  
dependent (to say once I dont't want function and  
during this session there is only some kind checkboxs  
to allow it again) - in cases it's very usefull.</detail>

        <detail>I have anywhere recoding on in phpMyAdmin 2.6.1-rc2, 
and I'm using MySQL 4.1.8.  
 
When I select utf-8 as the export charset (which is default) 
the resulting file does not begin with the utf-8 byte order 
marker which would enable my text editor to recognize it 
as a utf-8 file. Also, we have found that Excel 2003 for PC 
will only recognize a csv file as utf-8 if the file is opened 
using the Open dialog and the file has the utf-8 byte order 
marker. 
 
So, the feature request is to add the byte order marker to 
the beginning of exported utf-8 files, or at least to provide 
an option (either on the export screens or in the config 
file) to do so. 
 
The utf-8 byte order marker is the three hex bytes 
EFBBBF. Simply adding these three bytes at the beginning 
of exported utf-8 files closes this feature request.</detail>

When a table is displayed, we see this: 
 
Field Type Attributes Null Default Extra Action 
 
If a user doesn't have permission to change this table, should s/he see it? 
 
It would be cleaner to not display it. 
 
Likewise things like: 
&amp;quot;With selected: CHANGE  Or  DROP&amp;quot; 
 
&amp;quot;[ Browse ] [ Select ] [ Insert ] [ Empty ] [ Drop ]&amp;quot; 
 
&amp;quot;Insert data from a textfile into table&amp;quot; 
 
&amp;quot;Rename table to&amp;quot; 
 
etcetera should not be displayed, IF the user doesn't have permission to change them. 
 
My main concern/nervousness lies with that first &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;. I would like it to disappear if a user  
doesn't have the necessary permissions :)

I have a server with a lot of databases, and so it

        <detail>Hi 
 
I found out that bookmarked (saved) query is available 
only for the user who bookmarked the query (In 
PMA_bookmark table bookmarked queries are assigned for 
the user).  
 
Would it be possible to bookmark queries so that they 
would be available for all users. By selecting checkbox 
 (new checkbox next to bookmark field) user would be 
able to bookmark the query for all users not only for 
him/her self. So all users who has privileges to 
execute queries on the database/table would be able to 
execute bookmarker queries.

        <title>Editing record no &amp;gt; $cfgMaxRows  - ID: 502223</title>
        <detail>Hello! 
 
phpMyAdmin 2.2.3, Netscape 4.77 (or IE 5.5) 
Whn I make browse to table and choose some row for  
editing then after submiting data browser will show  
contents of table again. This is very good, but it  
works only if to look first $cfgMaxRows records. If to  
choose next page or to make some query then after  
finishing editing the browser returns page with  
properties of table. So if $cfgMaxRows is 50 then to  
edit step by step records 51, 52, 53.... you need to  
make several extra clicks (Browse--&amp;gt;next page) 
 
Maybe it's possible to add in editing window  
choices &amp;quot;do'nt save changes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;continiue editing  
with next record&amp;quot;.... 
 
Another thing. Is it possible to get rid of function  
cell in editing table. If I had 20 fields then it is  
quite boring to press 39 times [tab] key or eaven  
worse to point 20 times with mouse. This shold be user  
dependent (to say once I dont't want function and  
during this session there is only some kind checkboxs  
to allow it again) - in cases it's very usefull.</detail>

        <title>Non-Frames Version - ID: 1073136</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
Wouldn't it be great to have a non-frames version of  
phpMyAdmin so that it can work on all browsers (well  
nearly) reliably. In web design, frames went out of the  
window (excuse the pun) a long time ago! 
 
Without too much work, a table-based version can be  
created. With the left-frame being replaced by a table  
cell and the main frame by another. As phpMyAdmin is  
coded in PHP, it would just require a few include files to  
make the move. 
 
The non-frames version would make the clumsy, old,  
frames version obsolete and improve things for the users  
vastly. 
 
With a little more work, a CSS version could be created  
allowing phpMyAdmin to be accessible to everyone! 
 
What do you guys think? 
 
Looking forward to your feedback.</detail>

        <title>Privileges for non superuser - ID: 1295022</title>
        <detail>This was touched on by another support question, but  
mine is slightly different. 
 
I have a database provided by UK FastHosts. The owner  
(whome I log in as) has privileges to add other users  
and assign them privileges. I know this becuase I can  
do a &quot;GRANT select, update ....&quot; statement (in  
phpmyadmin's query window) and it adds users and  
correctly assigns then the privileges. 
 
The problem that I have is that in Phpmyadmin, there is  
no easy way to modify the privileges that have been  
assigned etc. The entire privileges link is not shown  
even though the owner is able to modify database  
privileges. 
 
I quess this is becuse the privileges tab is only shown if  
the logged in user has global privileges and database  
privileges are not taken into account. 
 
Is it feasible to add this as a RFC?</detail>

        <detail>As there is an option to limit phpMyAdmin to use  
certain Databases it would be nice to have an limit for  
certain tables. 
For example you have only one database at your  
provider and someone needs direct access to some  
tables. As there could be more tables you probably  
don't want the person to have access to that tables, too. 
So I suggest to have a tableLimit-option where you  
either can put in an array of allowed tables or a sort of  
mask like 'progx*'</detail>

        <title>Perform a mysqldump when dropping a database - ID: 2125009</title>
        <detail>I've done it, we've all probably done it. You go to drop a table and end up dropping the whole database instead. There's no recovery to that: restore from last backup. I've done it twice, once it cost me half a day's work and the other one, done yesterday, I get to start the database from scratch. 
I would like to see the system dump the database into a backup file and save it on the file system before it drops the whole database. Thus giving us something to recover from if we didn't actually intend to drop the whole database.  
 
Screen shot: 
This shows the layout of how I did it both times. Go into the database, check the two tables you want removed and click to the big &quot;drop&quot; button at the top. Say obscene words, throw keyboard, and then post message about how stupid you are and how you would like those smarter then you to fix your stupidity! 
 
I am willing to make the change myself and submit it.</detail>

        <title>multiple-field foreign key relation - ID: 1491452</title>
        <detail>It seems impossible to insert a foreing key relation 
with multiple fields by the relation interface. 
In practical  from the interface it is impossible to 
have the equivalent of the SQL: 
 
ALTER TABLE `locktable` 
  ADD CONSTRAINT `locktable_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY 
(`axoid`, `version`) REFERENCES `versionhistory` 
(`axoid`, `version`); 
 
since the interface generates: 
 
ALTER TABLE `locktable` 
  ADD CONSTRAINT `locktable_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY 
(`axoid`) REFERENCES `versionhistory` (`axoid`), 
  ADD CONSTRAINT `locktable_ibfk_2` FOREIGN KEY 
(`version`) REFERENCES `versionhistory` (`version`); 
 
Is it possible to add this (for me) useful operation?

        <title>Less JavaScript, please! - ID: 3528204</title>
        <detail>Hello guys, 
 
I love phpMyAdmin for my databases. But the new versions of phpMyAdmin are getting worse in my opinion. 
The reason: JavaScript slows down the page more and more. My customers say it, too. 
Creating a table in a pop-up is incredibly annoying. I can't move or resize the popup in internet explorer and the page is in firefox slowly. 
Must be an annoying pop-ups for all that? It will probably be helpful but it does not a bit, quite the opposite. 
 
Das neue Design ist allerdings sehr bersichtlich! Dafr ein groes Lob! 
 
I hope you understand what I mean and I hope for improvement.

        <title>Improve &quot;Relational View&quot; Interface - ID: 3160927</title>
        <detail>I generally add foreign keys using the sql statements, however some times I use the &quot;Relational View&quot; interface to add a foreign key relation - in a database with hundreds of tables, it is a real pain to scroll through all the relations and then identify the one which is required ( though thy are in alphabetical order, if there are lots of tables then it becomes difficult)  
Suggestion - Instead of showing all the foreign key relations in one drop down, it would be nice to break it down into two drop downs (1. drop down that lists all the tables and 2. When a table is selected, it lists all the columns in the table)  
Advantages  
1. Makes it easy to select the right table and the required column - user friendly  
2. Avoids setting up the wrong keys ( i myself have associated wrong keys many times due to similar table names and column names)</detail>

        <detail>Hi, 
 
phpMyAdmin should normalize a table. This means that I  
can select one or more columns from a table,  
phpMyAdmin can extract them top another table and fills  
a different column in the old table with the primary index. 
Possible options counld be: 
- automaticly create the new table 
- automaticly create the index column 
- add a comment and the depends in the phpMyAdmin- 
Database 
- Search for an exiting item before insert (in case the  
new table exists and has some items)

Well, 1000 might be better or it might not, why not have (int) $cfg['PmaLinkOrButtonLimit'] with 1000 (or 2047, if you like) as default?  
 
Some phpmyadmin installations are just for one person having a most-liked browser. These person would know, or could just try out, which ist the best limit. Buttons are just inconvinient, since thy dont allow neither &quot;open in new window&quot; nor &quot;copy link url to clipboard&quot;.

        <title>MySQL dump - ID: 1113030</title>
        <detail>Hi @ all. 
 
It would be nice to implement big MySQL dumps (backup  
&amp; restore) with phpMyAdmin.  
 
It is possible to do this in script! 
Why phpMyAdmin can't do this? 
 
You must simply call the script itself with a parameter if  
you prevent the php execution timeout. 
 
Hope that this is implemented in one of the next  
versions. 
 
phpMyAdmin is a nice tool!

        <title>(in 2.5.1) left frame table selection by prefix - ID: 539754</title>
        <detail>hi guys, 
a nice feature would be the option to display only  
tables in the left frame which include a runtime  
definable prefix. this is good if you have various  
pages on the same server and only own one mysql  
database. so you have to use, for example  
homepage1_newstable and so on, to correctly define the  
tables. and this results in a real problem if you have  
about 180 tables in the left frame :) so it would be  
nice to have a text box at the top of the left frame  
where you can define this prefix (or maybe postfix). 
thanx in advance</detail>

        <title>DB alias / table alias for each server - ID: 1106640</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
Now I'm using many databases on localhost, because some 
ISP setup their MySQL-Server like listet below: 
- MySQL is running as localhost 
- each database for the users is named like 
  usrdb_username_* (* is a number) 
 
I setup up my config.inc.php with all my servers 
(databases) and I get the dropdownbox for server select 
like this: 
    localhost-usrdb_username_1 (username) 
    ... 
    localhost-usrdb_username_5 (username) 
 
With usrdb_username_* (username) it's confused, because 
I must really know which db stores my required datas. 
Now I've added  
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['db_alias_name']=&quot;Forum-DB&quot;; 
and modified the &quot;libraries/select_server.lib.php&quot; to 
show an alias for server-database. 
 
Is it possible to include this in PMA?

        <detail>Ok, maybe I'm the only person who needs this, then  
again maybe not, but on some queries that I run, I  
need to let MySQL chug away (REGEXP, lots of joins,  
etc). Is there a way to let me click a checkbox since  
there may be cases where letting the script chug away  
would be a bad thing... thus, let the DBA/programmer  
decide if they want to take that risk. 
 
I did look at lib.inc.php, but it seems like the  
values are hardcoded,a dn the max being 20min.

        <title>Table filtering - ID: 1501125</title>
        <detail>Would be fine to have table filtering feature! 
 
I have single database access, so I use prefixed 
tables. Therefore I have a lot tables. This means, a set of 
prefixed tables is assumed as a single database by me. 
So if I want to work only with tables prefixed with 
db1_*, then it is a pain for me without filtering feature. 
 
Suggestion:  
Let we have a filter form, where I can type to list all 
tables matching 'db1_*'.

        <title>rename multiple tables - ID: 2703267</title>
        <detail>A few weeks ago I had to rename multiple tables, replacing a mutual prefix to another prefix. I looked for a function in phpMyAdmin to do this, couldn't find it, and finally ended up writing a small php script to rename some tables with an identical pattern (prefix, suffix, ...). 
Renaming multiple tables might be a useful feature for phpMyAdmin. 
 
(example script : http://ruleant.blogspot.com/2009/03/rename-multiple-tables-in-mysql.html ) 
 
If you think it is a useful feature, I would like to give it a try to implement it in phpMyAdmin.</detail>

        <detail>Dear phpMyAdmin team, 
 
1) I would love to have more actions for multiple 
selected tables in the database view: 
 
 
- Export 
- Change Type 
- Change Collation 
 
 
2) Additional Javascript Selects on the column titels 
would be useful, too. 
 
- JavaScript link on &quot;Type&quot; selects all tables of one 
type (MyISAM, InnoDB, ...), next click on the link 
deselects and select all tables of the next type found 
- The same for &quot;Collations&quot; 
 
 
3) Alternatively / additionally sorting of columns: 
- Table, Items, Type, Collation, Size 
 
 
Keep up the good work,

However, isHttp() will return false, since the server itself is &quot;http&quot; only and the result is that PMA redirects to the &quot;http&quot;-URL after login - unless I configure ForceSSL=1, which causes an infinite redirect loop. 
 
I'd like to have a method to tell PMA that it _is_ running on https really. 
 
My hack looks as follows: 
in isHttps I've added the following at the beginning: 
    if( defined('PMA_IS_HTTPS') ) { 
        return PMA_IS_HTTPS; 
    } 
and in config.inc.php:

        <title>make import options configurable - ID: 1144052</title>
        <detail>I noticed that in ldi_table [using 2.6.0-pl3] that the 
options for accepting the format of a file to be 
uploaded are hard coded. Eg: on line 108, the input 
name field_terminator has a value of &quot;;&quot;. 
 
It might be a good idea to have a configuration feature 
where one can define field_termintor, fields enclosed 
by, fields escaped by, lines terminated by and the LOAD 
method. This would mimick the behavor of the export 
feature, which has these fields defined in the 
config.inc.php. 
 
Since I often import and export CSV files, I've changed 
the defaults in my config so that the export always 
defaults to a &quot;,&quot; instead of the &quot;;&quot;. Having that same 
ability for importing would be a Good Thing. :) 
 
In the meantime, I've edited ldi_table to meet my 
needs. Thanks for considering this...

        <title>Report attempts to connect to mysql with old_password method - ID: 3459102</title>
        <detail>Certain Linux distributions still use mysqld 5.0 as their current mysql server (now considered old compared to 5.5). 
 
When a (new) phpmyadmin version, running on a php installation with mysqlnd driver, attempts to connect, mysqlnd complains that it will _not_ use the old authentication method to connect to the server, and login fails no matter what username and password are provided. 
 
In this case the user gets no indication of the compatibility problem or a suggestion to upgrade/fix password hashes, but can only see the 'Could not login' message from phpmyadmin. The login from the command line mysql client will work just fine. 
 
Can phpmyadmin please display an appropriate message in this case, like the warning message from php (mysqlnd) ? 
Together with, or Instead of, the not-so-specific  'Could not login' mesage ?

        <title>(in 2.7.1) Convert illegal character by default - ID: 1380255</title>
        <detail>Please add the //TRANSLIT parameter to the  
out_charset parameter of the iconv() function by  
default! This would have saved me and probably many  
other developers hours of grief! 
 
Problem now: 
If your database is likely to contain text copied  
from Microsoft Word documents, it's very likely that  
you will get this error message when trying to export  
or import it with phpMyAdmin: &quot;Notice: iconv():  
Detected an illegal character in input string in  
file.php on line x&quot;. This is because of the evil  
0x96 &quot;long dash&quot; character. MS Word as default (!)  
converts all double hyphens into this illegal  
character. The solution is either to convert 0x96  
(dash) into the regular 0x2d (hyphen/minus), or to  
append the //TRANSLIT (try and convert the character)  
or //IGNORE (drop the character) parameters to the  
iconv function. 
 
Read more here:  
http://php.net/manual/en/function.iconv.php 
 
Thanks for considering this.

        <title>(ok 3.3) filter tables - ID: 1238216</title>
        <detail>Hi! 
 
I am working on some databases with a large amount of 
tables; many of them are temporary (not real temporary 
tables, but they have only a limited lifetime) which is 
obvious from their names, like TEMPXXXX. 
 
It would be very handy if we could configure table name 
filters on per-server-basis. Any table name matching 
that filter would not be displayed. 
 
I think about having something like  
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension'][ 'filter' ] = array() 
in the config file, the array containing PCREs; if any 
of them matches a table name this is not displayed in 
the table name list (left/center frame) 
 
If there is interest in such a feature I think I could 
implement it; we will need this feature anyway, but 
having it in phpMyAdmin would make updates a lot easier ;)

        <title>(ok 2.10) Option to not display record counts for views - ID: 1548637</title>
        <detail>In Short: 
PhpMyAdmin brings down our server when it attempts to 
get record counts for complex views which take a long 
time to run. We have to kill the processes manually.  
 
The fix for us was to disable the record counts for 
views, but it would be nice to have an option to do so 
more easily within the config.inc.php 
 
- 
The fix: 
To 'libraries/common.lib.php' where I commented out 
lines 1421 - 1428 (search file for 'SELECT 1'). I 
replaced the if block with a hard coded '$num = 0;' 
 
- 
// OLD 
if (!isset($num)) { 
    if (! $tbl_is_view) { 
        $num = PMA_DBI_fetch_value('SELECT COUNT(*) AS 
num FROM ' . PMA_backquote($db) . '.' . 
PMA_backquote($table)); 
        // necessary? 
        if (! $num) { 
            $num = 0; 
        } 
    // since counting all rows of a view could be too long 
    } else { 
         // try_query because if can fail (a VIEW was 
based on a 
         // table that no longer exists) 
         $result = PMA_DBI_try_query('SELECT 1 FROM ' . 
PMA_backquote($db) . '.' . PMA_backquote($table) . ' 
LIMIT ' . $cfg['MaxExactCount'], null, 
PMA_DBI_QUERY_STORE); 
         if (!PMA_DBI_getError()) { 
             $num = PMA_DBI_num_rows($result); 
         } else { 
             $num = 0; 
         } 
    } 
} 
 
// NEW 
if (!isset($num)) { 
    if (! $tbl_is_view) { 
        $num = PMA_DBI_fetch_value('SELECT COUNT(*) AS 
num FROM ' . PMA_backquote($db) . '.' . 
PMA_backquote($table)); 
        // necessary? 
        if (! $num) { 
            $num = 0;

        <title>(in 2.5.2) Plain password in Cookie Mode on phpinfo() - ID: 564793</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
The phpMyAdmin's Cookie Mode is very great and  
user-friendly when compared to httpauth  
(prompting a dialog) and config(plain text  
passwords in config file).  
 
Of late, I noticed a serious security hazard with this  
cookie mode, whilst I was debugging my php script  
and checking phpinfo for information. It was  
revealing my database username and database  
password that too in unencrypted state.  
 
I would like to suggest that at least this password  
be garbled in some fashion since many production  
sites to use phpMyadmin.   
 
Perhaps a session id can store this password.  
 
But for that phpMyAdmin is simply fantastic,  
excellent and invincible.

        <title>(ok 3.4) Create INSERT query - ID: 2033616</title>
        <detail>Hi all, 
 
When inserting data from my applications, i always use this form of INSERT.. 
 
INSERT INTO table (field1, field2, field3) VALUES ('value1', 'value2', 'value3'); 
 
This normally requires some tabbing between PMA and my editor. To read the specific fields or copy-paste field names from PMA to editor one at the time. 
 
So sometimes i just use the Insert function in PMA and copy the query. But i don't think it's optimal to actually get test data into the table. So i usually deletes the data and changes the AUTO_INCREMENT value. This is no big issue while the website is in developent. But once it has gone to production this is not the way to go! 
 
So all i ask for is &quot;Generate Insert Query&quot; feature that can generate an INSERT query without add'ing data to table. 
 
This is how i imagine it could be solved. 
 
For instance under &quot;Insert&quot; tab, there could be an extra option in the &quot;Insert as new row&quot; drop down. &quot;Create query (no insert)&quot;, and perhaps a way to populate empty fields with data, also using Function. 
 
--without populate-- 
INSERT INTO people (field_id, field_status, field_name, field_password) VALUES (null, '0', 'Philip', MD5('somepass')); 
 
In without populate i have input Philip into field_name and somepass into field_password and selected MD5 for function on field_password. Empty fields should get their default value, 0 in field_status' case. And autoincrement fields should just get null if empty. 
 
 
--with populate-- 
INSERT INTO people (field_id, field_status, field_name, field_password) VALUES (null, 'field_status', 'Philip', MD5('field_password')); 
 
In with populate i have only input Philip into field_name. and selected MD5 as function for field_password. The autoincrement fields i think should be null if empty. Other empty fields should just be populated with field as data, as with field_status and field_password. 
 
I hope this request is not totally stupid :) 
 
I could sure use it!</detail>

        <title>(in 2.6.1) Constructive criticism for suboptimal indexes - ID: 1044677</title>
        <detail>A coworker of mine suggested that it might be helpful if PMA 
would take more notice of the indexes users create, and provide 
constructive criticism to the user in the event that indexes 
are created which have little or no value. The immediate 
examples we came up with were: 
 
- having multiple identical indexes for the same column 
- adding an index to a field that already has a unique index 
- adding an index to a field that is already the primary key 
- adding an index to a field X when you already have an index 
  on columns (X,Y), in that order (but not if the existing 
  index is on (Y,X), in that order). 
 
PMA should not prevent the creation of such indexes (because 
PMA should also catch such indexes created outside of PMA or 
with older versions of PMA). Instead, PMA should maybe display 
a warning message for any such indexes that exist, explaining 
why the index isn't useful. 
 
PMA likely cannot contain logic to detect and report all the 
possible ways a nonsense index could be created, but it can at 
least recognize the above cases, and probably a few more. And 
this would help those individuals who are not sufficiently 
versed in indexes. This would include, for example, everyone 
in the web design company where I work, including me, except 
for the coworker who made this suggestion, who has just spent 
the past several days adding and fixing indexes in one of our 
larger applications. The above suggestions are based on the 
most common errors he discovered made by other programmers in 
our project.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.5.4-rc1) $cfg['LimitChars'] only limits TEXT / BLOB - ID: 742123</title>
        <detail>I have been speaking with Lem99 off-line about this. I believe $cfg['LimitChars'] needs to be changed, or  
at least updated. I am not sure Marc agrees with me. But let me ask you to keep these two questions in  
mind as you are reading: &amp;quot;what was the original use of $cfg['LimitChars'] ?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Was it to limit the length of  
what the user sees in the browse window. Why does it not apply to other potentially long fields as well?&amp;quot; 
 
As Marc mentions, $cfg['LimitChars'] should instead be named $cfg['LimitTextBlob']. 
 
I believe the project should go one step further: apply $cfg['LimitChars'] to ALL potentially long fields in  
the browse window. I am not talking about a specific request that would only be useful for me. This is not  
a special request ONLY useful for me! It will be useful for everyone who appreciates what  
$cfg['LimitTextBlob'] does! 
 
My reasoning is that: 
 
if $cfg['LimitChars'] is useful in limiting the length of Text and Blob fields in the browse window, 
it will also be useful in limiting other fields whose possible long length obstructs the zen of what  
$cfg['LimitTextBlob'] is trying to accomplish. 
 
For example, it does not apply to a varchar(255) or a longtext. Why not a longtext at least? 
I suspect, it does not apply to a mediumtext, mediumblob or longblob field. 
But $cfg['LimitChars'] should apply to these potentially long fields, otherwise what purpose does  
$cfg['LimitChars'] serve? 
 
Applying $cfg['LimitChars'] to date, datetime, year or time MIGHT be a waste of time. But I am sure a  
majority of users would appreciate $cfg['LimitChars'] applying to varchars or other long-in-length fields 
 
$cfg['LimitChars'] should have a greater, more useful purpose: to limit chars, not just text and blob.

Maybe adding a new configuration parameter:

        <title>Relationship on a different server - ID: 826366</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
i have an external database with less space and an  
internal database. on the internal server, i have installed  
phpmyadmin and the connection to the external system  
works fine. 
the problem is the external less space. the relations- 
database is very usefull, but uses some space. 
there should be an option in the configuration-file, so  
that i can tell phpmyadmin that the relation-database is  
stored not on the external, but on the internal system.  
best: i can setup a server with username/password  
where this information is stored. 
 
regards,

        <title>faster use of keyboard with javascript - ID: 465550</title>
        <detail>I suppose to make some small improvements in the  
interface with smal javascript statements: 
1. sql.php 
if you want to deleate an entry it is better if the  
submitbutton for yes has the focus, when the page is  
loaded, so you can just press &amp;quot;enter&amp;quot;. 
give the form a name: 
&amp;lt;form action=&amp;quot;sql.php&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;DoYouReallyWantForm&amp;quot; ... 
 
then add: 
&amp;lt;script language=&amp;quot;JavaScript&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;!-- // 
  document.DoYouReallyWantForm.elements[10].focus(); 
// --&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; 
 
2. index.php 
the frameset should have a resizeable boarder: 
&amp;lt;frameset  cols=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;?php echo $cfgLeftWidth; ?&amp;gt;,*&amp;quot;   
rows=&amp;quot;*&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 
 
3. 
all input fields where it makes sense shoudld have: 
onfocus=&amp;quot;this.select()&amp;quot; 
 
4.  
try to put more information on one page, with 
a.  a smaller font for the table name on top 
b.  less padding in the tables 
c.  the &amp;lt;body marginheight=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; topmargin=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;  
leftmargin=&amp;quot;3&amp;quot; marginwidth=&amp;quot;3&amp;quot; ... 
d.  put the ok-button on the right of the sql-textarea 
 
5.  
put the SQL query-textarea on top of the indexes,  
couse you need it more often 
 
6. put &amp;quot;Browse -  Select -  Insert -  Empty&amp;quot; on top of  
page</detail>

        <title>(in 2.5.0) Highlight SQL fields - ID: 638800</title>
        <detail>If you use your own sql query, it would be cool if the rows/fields after which you've checked are highlighted. As I have to do with tables with more than 30 rows/fields, it is very annoying to search this while page for 1 row. 
 
Example: 
You entered the query &amp;quot;SELECT * FROM table WHERE row35 &amp;gt; 100 AND row37 &amp;lt; 20&amp;quot; 
In the result view, row35 and row37 should be highlighted.</detail>

        <title>Deep relational linking on Insert screen - ID: 772988</title>
        <detail>I'd like to see the relational links on the Insert page, and  
possibly in the relational popups. I have a database  
where I've put all text elements into a separate text  
table to simplify i18n. The tables that have links to the  
text table also link to one another. Of course, the logical  
element to show when entering data is the name field.  
But that is a link to the text table so all I see is number. 
 
As an example: 
 
  objects.content -&amp;gt; contents.id 
  contents.name -&amp;gt; text.id 
 
  contents field to display: name 
  text field to display: data 
 
In the drop down for objects.content I'd like to see the  
text.data related to contents.name rather than the text. 
id (which is relatively meaningless)

        <title>Show bookmarks on browse page - ID: 3037087</title>
        <detail>there should be an option to set default view when clicking on browse button on the left. For example I have a table and i always need it to be sorted in reverse order. So on the right I need a button &quot;Use this query a default&quot; for this table and this query should be used every time i click in the left tree. Something like that would be very useful, it very annoying to set sort options for the same table again and again. Also options like Partial Texts / Full Texts should be remembered, it's very annoying to switch all the time to Full texts 
 
Also there should be an options to hide certain columns of a table, so there can be some sort of short and full columns view.

        <title>Custom CSS - ID: 965553</title>
        <detail>The new config.header and config.footer files that debut with PMA  
2.6.0 are very nice and I'm using them to help me restyle PMA  
with new CSS definitions. But these header and footer files are  
only included on the files loaded into the right frame. Would you  
consider providing something similar for the left frames and the  
popup windows? 
 
I primarily just want to be able to stuff some new CSS definitions  
into all the PMA pages, regardless of which frame or popup window  
they load into. If a config file directive were available which  
provided this capability, separate header and footer files for the  
pages in the left frames and popup windows would not be needed. 
 
This kind of custom CSS file should be loaded in addition to the  
standard PMA file, I think, so that the server administrator need  
only write into the CSS file those directives that differ from the  
standard distribution, rather than duplicating many directives that  
would be identical.</detail>

Is the CVS import supposed to work for entire databases? Or just one table at a time? 
 
When I export a wordpress or joomla database as CVS and then try to import it, it creates one large table with all off the data called &quot;TABLE 1&quot; 
 
Is it working as intended to only apply on a &quot;per table&quot; basis? Perhaps this option should only become available when a specific table is selected, but not the entire db.</detail>

        <title>Functionality enhancement - ID: 852158</title>
        <detail>I am a relatively new user of PHPMyAdmin, having  
migrated to it when we upgraded to Linux. Now that I  
have been using it for a number of months. 
 
I use the product to enter in the data for a database  
on a database driven website I own, and I think I have  
come up with a function that would greatly improve my  
use of the product. As I am not a programmer pers I  
am not that good at trying to use the SQL language, so  
I am look at a possibility of user-friendly data  
manipulation. 
 
The enhanced functionality should be added to when one  
is viewing the data with the 'Browse' function. I am  
thinking, there is a Edit function, and a Delete  
function, so now I am thinking there should be a  
multiple record Edit function as well. 
 
What I envisage, is a check box in front of the Edit  
button. Then one can tick that box and click a global  
Edit button at the bottom of the list. This will then  
make the selected field editable without leaving the  
Browse mode, i.e. similar to when you use the Change  
to change fields of a table when you are looking at  
the Structure of a database. 
 
I am wondering whether this is at all possible to  
implement as a user-friendly, programming-free  
interface for someone like me who is very much a  
beginner with your product.</detail>

        <title>use aliases in SQL export for tables and columns - ID: 1252109</title>
        <detail>When exporting to a SQL query phpMyAdmin will break 
functions into multiple columns. It will then remove 
the same ammount of columns passed to the funciton from 
the end of the column list. 
 
ex: 
SELECT  
  CONCAT( 'DOMAIN\\' , `username` ) AS 'uname', 
  'fullname'; 
 
will export a query: 
INSERT INTO table  
( 
  `DOMAIN\\`, 
  `username`) 
VALUES  
( 
  'DOMAIN\\john', 
  'John Doe' 
); 
instead of ...table (`uname`,`fullname`) values... 
 
 
Similarly, phpMyAdmin doesnt recognise renamed columns 
in the export: 
select `name` as 'fullname' where 1; 
will export: 
insert into table ('name') values ('John Doe');</detail>

        <title>existing pmadb difficult to upgrade (to include tracking) - ID: 3009996</title>
        <detail>Since the new (3.3.x) tracking feature -- which is great -- we don't seem to have a way for users with an existing pmadb to simply add the tracking table. Ideally, phpMyAdmin could detect that the pmadb is configured in config.inc.php and offer to create the missing tables (any missing tables, which would simplify installation in general, I suppose). This should probably (in my head) be suggested by the error thrown in the verbose_check section, but maybe I'm wrong about that. 
 
As a short term measure, how do you feel about offering upgrade .sql scripts for each version -- so there's be upgrade-to-3.3.3.sql and upgrade-to-4.0.sql which users could run in order when doing a major upgrade. I'm just thinking out loud, could be that I'm missing something.

        <title>Improve &quot;Grouping&quot; of tables (left nav pane) - ID: 1727853</title>
        <detail>See the screenshot attached. 
 
The grouping code currently groups with the seperator &quot;_&quot; (which is configurable). 
 
However as you can see in the screenshot, this way grouping will only catch tables that have the &quot;_&quot; in their names. For example consider this heirchy of tables: 
 
 
users 
users_permissions 
users_language 
users_timezone 
 
etc... 
 
It would be very helpfull to have all 4 of the above tables grouped under the first table &quot;users&quot;. 
 
Currently this is what happens 
 
    users 
[+] users (3) 
 
 
Does anyone else agree with me? :-)

        <title>Improvements to LOAD DATA (LOCAL) INFILE  - ID: 740607</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
The &amp;quot;Insert data from a textfile into table&amp;quot; feature 
proceeds 
in to steps: 
  1. The user file is first uploaded to the web server host 
     (where it is stored in the /tmp directory) 
  2. phpMyAdmin performs a &amp;quot;LOAD DATA INFILE&amp;quot; request 
     which is WRONG! 
 
Instead it should perform a &amp;quot;LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE&amp;quot; 
because the file to be loaded is located on the MySQL 
client host, not on the MySQL server host. 
 
However, in most situations, the server and the client are 
both running on the same host. So there is no difference 
beetween doing a &amp;quot;LOAD DATA INFILE&amp;quot; or 
a &amp;quot;LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE&amp;quot; request ... 
except that, in the first case, you need the FILE privilege 
(in addition to the INSERT or UPDATE privileges). 
In the second case, you don't need the FILE privilege. 
 
The FILE privilege is ONLY needed when you want 
to read data from text files located on the server ! 
 
Cheers,

        <title>Make the deafult theme's font size the same as 2.7 - ID: 1442153</title>
        <detail>Please, make the default theme's font size the same  
as it was in 2.7 
 
In request #1436836 you require the user to change  
the default font size in the browser.  However you  
have to consider which browser is the most used  
around the globe (65.2% Internet Explorer, 25.1%  
Firefox), and of those, which percentage has the  
default font face to 'Times New Roman' and a 'Medium'  
or '16 pt' font size (95%), so 85% of your possible  
users are likely to see a great diference in font  
sizes when upgrading from 2.7 to 2.8   
 
So if you want to require your users to change the  
font size locally, you'll be forcing them to switch  
the font size of every site on the internet that does  
no use absolute font sizes (like pt or px). 
 
Now if you don't want to 'hardcode' the font size,  
then I suggest to be at least configurable in the  
config.inc.php file, which could be easier for the  
sysadmin to configure since now a setup wizard is  
available</detail>

        <title>Add Ajax For Edit SQL popup - ID: 3273694</title>
        <detail>Hi phpMyAdmins, 
 
I would like to propose a UI improvement using AJAX. I am not sure if this has been already proposed, but I think it is not and I would like to work on it as GSoC 2011 work if approved. 
 
Under the Browse Section, when a user clicks on the edit button, there's a popup window. With the current multitabbed browsers, it is sometimes very confusing for me to find my actual edit popup window. I would propose for a AJAXified textarea to accept input from the textarea, and do a refresh for the div that shows the resultset. I wish to provide more details in my proposal. 
 
Look forward to your reply, 
 
Thank you,

        <title>Problems with table buttons (Empty,Drop) - ID: 3158719</title>
        <detail>The current quality of warning before dropping a table (which can be holding thousands of lines of information) is not good at all. The current interface (specially the table buttons) priorize size and simplicity (to save screen space)  but lets SECURITY to a second plan, giving chance to disasters. 
In English the label buttons make it very clear &quot;Empty&quot; and &quot;Drop&quot;, they have dramatically different meanings. But in other languages as in Portuguese, the translation of one simple word can lead to confusion (and disasters) because &quot;Limpar&quot; e &quot;Eliminar&quot; have very similar meanings, so, a person can select some rows and click on the last button instead of the penultimate, thinking they are cleaning the selected rows, - Ok, a waring with lower case message (which passes almost unwatched) is presented, but the user don't read, they think: OK, delete my selected rows, fast !!! - and UNFORTUNATELY is surprised with a dropped table message ! I am here to suggest adding one simple word in the second button label, the word TABLE for all languages, because when you read &quot;Eliminar Tabela&quot; (equivalent to &quot;Drop Table&quot;)  you will be much more able to avoid clicking in the last button to clean some table rows... Please pay attention to this, it is a big trouble dropping a table when you wanted to delete a few rows... The habit of guessing a confirmation dialog in this case causes the disaster. This could also be reduced by USING CAPITAL LETTERS TO CALL  ATTENTION !!!</detail>

        <title>reverse chronological display by default - ID: 1338822</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
PhpMyAdmin rocks.  One thing I'd love to see is default 
browse in reverse chronological order when I click on 
each table. 
 
I realise that this might not be the ideal default for 
everyone, but for me it would save a lot of time.  
Pretty much 80% of the time that's the first thing I'm 
doing - click browse and then go to the last page of 
results. 
 
Even if this wasn't default for the whole system, it 
would be great if I could set it so it was default for me. 
 
Many thanks.

        <title>(in 2.5.2) Add checkbox for AUTO_INCREMENT export - ID: 763957</title>
        <detail>First mentioned in forum: 
 
I am annoyed at the &amp;quot;AUTO_INCREMENT&amp;quot; addition to the 
table export. Please either include a checkbox to 
exclude this or make it switchable in the config file. 
For me, it is useless and I must edit it out (hence an 
extra step) when I want to export then recreate a 
table. Yeah, it's nice that mysql supports this, but 
not everything is a good idea. 
 
More importantly, either disable it or have a checkbox 
or WARN the user when they use the &amp;quot;copy table to&amp;quot; 
feature under &amp;quot;Operations&amp;quot;. This used to work 
beautifully until &amp;quot;AUTO_INCREMENT&amp;quot; was added (2.5.1?). 
W/o any warning, it worked differently and it messed up 
my IDs for a table (I wanted them to start at 1, not 
94823).</detail>

        <title>Save as File to Server - ID: 900792</title>
        <detail>The features on the Export tab work perfectly, but  
there needs to be another toggle allowing us to save it  
to the server. 
 
I have many tables that exceed 7MB in size and the  
server does not have enough memory (zipped or  
gzipped) to download them to my computer. If it could  
save to the server (perhaps in a /backup folder) then it  
could be a really nice new feature...

This can be really helpful for a table with many columns. For example, if a user wants to compare two

Although he can also write a select query for the same purpose.</detail>

        <title>Reserved words such as ORDER or GROUP - ID: 444831</title>
        <detail>When I tried to create a table named 'order' full of  
orders to process, I received no error. phpMyAdmin  
processed the command without error. It took me quite  
awhile to realize that I was using a reserved word. 
 
Later, the same thing happened when I tried to create  
a table named 'group'. No error, but whenever I tried  
to create that field, nothing happened. 
 
Can phpMyAdmin post an error message back,  
saying &amp;quot;sorry, you can't create a field named 'order'  
because shortly, you're going to want to order your  
fields, and you can't order order!&amp;quot;

        <detail>What about a feature to inform users which try to use  
a keyword of MySQL as a name of tables or columns. On  
support-platforms you get several task like &quot;why is my  
query 'SELECT read FROM select' doesn't work?&quot;. To  
prevent these maybe you could add a keyword checker  
for table/column names. So every try someone add a  
table with a keyword he gets a warning (not an error)  
that he is using a keyword as a name and should be use  
another name for it. If the user knows what he do he  
can click on sth. like &quot;Edit Anyway&quot; and it save/add/ 
edit the table anyway.</detail>

        <detail>It would be really convenient to condense the data in a 
table if, when deleting the latest entry in a table 
that has AUTO_INCREMENT defined on the primary key, 
phpMyAdmin would automatically lower the AUTO_INCREMENT 
value to the smallest possible value. This could be 
implemented in several ways: either have the normal 
delete row key automatically lower the value after the 
deletion, or add an additional delete key for this 
purpose, or add a checkbox that reads something like 
&quot;condense auto_increment after deleting&quot; that could be 
checked on or off.</detail>

hesitate to contact the Finnish translator Visa  
Kopu, visa@visakopu.net.&amp;quot;

This is what I mean... 
 
Sometimes I see this : 
 
 
Other times I see this : 
 
 
And at other times I see this instead : 
 
 
I think you get the point now..

        <title>(in 2.6.0) Use Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer for export - ID: 968110</title>
        <detail>It would be nice to have an option where multiple tables 
of a database could be exported as separate sheets in one 
Excel file. A CSV export is clearly not sufficient for this, 
but there is a PEAR module called Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer 
which allows this and some other neat options, including 
some formatting. Perhaps this could be made an option in 
the export screen. It could even be conditionalized, so that 
the option to export a real Excel file is not available unless 
this PEAR module is installed. 
 
Using this Excel export module should also fix the fact that 
Excel for Mac and Excel for Windows require differing CSV 
formats to work properly. It would simplify the task of 
exporting something that everyone can open in Excel, while 
at the same time making it a more pleasant experience 
through some simple formatting (like bolding the column 
headers, or whatever). 
 
The only problem is that the PEAR module is beta, and this 
may be of concern to some. But I have used it successfully 
in other projects. 
 
See also bug #951226 where this feature request was 
first voiced.</detail>

        <title>Defining relationships - ID: 825505</title>
        <detail>The method for defining relationships within phpMyAdmin  
is to start at the MANY of a ONE-to-MANY relationship  
and to link the foreign key of MANY (many.fk) to the  
(usually) primary key of ONE (one.pk). 
 
This has the disadvantage that a foreign key field can  
only be linked to a single foreign table. In my long  
experience of designing, building and using databases I  
quite often come across the situation where a foreign  
key field can be linked to more than one foreign table. 
 
In all the database administration tools I have used to  
date the method for defining relationships starts at the  
ONE and not the MANY table. The method is as follows: 
a) Choose a table as the ONE in a ONE-to-MANY  
relationship. 
b) Create a relationship entry (a table can have any  
number of these). 
c) Choose the unique key - this is usually the primary  
key but may be a candidate key (but not an index). 
d) Choose the MANY table in this relationship. 
e) For each field within the unique key of ONE (note that  
unique keys may contain several fields) identify the  
corresponding foreign key field within MANY. 
 
I would really like to enter relationships in this way.</detail>

        <title>Something to export in batch mode - ID: 1831908</title>
        <detail>It is difficult to export from an internet provider in a batch mode.  
 
The currently export script is only designed for an interactive use, but for an automatic backup with parameter it is very difficult. Actually, it work for me but with form post data with wget, and parameters are difficult to find. 
 
Is it possible to think to a script for this use, so a cron job could  run the script with all parameters for backup.  
 
By example, parameters in a file in an interactive first backup, and next backups could be realised with the same parameter file. Ideally, if it could login at the same place.

========== 
$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']: 
If enabled allows you to log in to arbitrary servers using cookie auth.  
========== 
 
The login page allows the user to type an arbitrary server host (as documented), but *does not* allow the user to specify the mysql server port, neither understands the host:port format. 
 
Please extend the functionality to either support host:port notation in the Server field in the Log In page or add a dedicated text field for the port number. 
 
========== 
Background: 
I am connecting to MySQL severs via ssh tunnels, which tunnels maps several ports to several remote MySQL servers. For different reasons it is not usable for me to configure all the used tunnels in the config.inc.php file. Thus I need to be able to specify the [mapped by the tunnel] port number together with the host in the Log In page.</detail>

        <title>New Admin/Basic GUI modes (PMA Light) - ID: 735925</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
I have set up laboratory infomation/data management 
system (Apache, MySQL, phpMyAdmin). Now some people 
feel www-interface more complicated. In order to make 
www-interface to database more intuitive and simpler 
for laboratory stuff  it should be possible to hide 
certain pages from phpMyAdmin GUI.   There could be two 
different modes of operation (Basic and Admin). For 
example in database view only 'Export', 'Search' and 
'Query' tabs should be visible in Basic mode. In table 
view only 'Browse', 'Select', 'Insert' and 'Export'  
tabs should be visible in Basic mode. This new feature 
could be configurable through config.ini.php3. Ofcourse 
in Admin mode all the possible pages should be visible. 
 
I know that phpMyAdmin in designed for database admins 
but this new feature would make phpMyAdmin more 
suitable also for other purposes. Simpler GUI mode 
would provide more general GUI to database without 
administrative functions. Normal users (not admins) 
would see simpler interface and feel them selves more 
comfortable.

        <detail>Attached is an md5/cookie authentication method so  
that the password will not be sent as plain text over the  
internet over non-SSL connections. 
 
The version I made for my site uses the CHAP login  
method - a random session variable is created to ensure  
against a replay attack (eavesdropping). 
 
Before the form is sent, the password and the random  
variable is changed to an md5 hash. 
 
Then we check the form md5 hashes against the md5  
hash for the password entered in the config and the md5  
hash for the random session variable. 
 
If both match, the password from the config is used to  
access the database. 
 
Thoughts, suggestions?

        <title>Validate manual date time input - ID: 2983973</title>
        <detail>I'm using phpMyAdmin for last few years and i have modified few things in order to make things easy for me. This year i would like to participate in gsoc as well. I would like to share those improvements if it is useful for everyone who uses phpMyAdmin. 
When entering date time value in the textbox if the user enters some invalid values mistakenly no errors thrown. When we are executing the insert/update the error is shown as mysql sql error, which takes too much time of the users when they make mistakes. 
Therefore what i did with my phpMyAdmin is that, when enters the date time manually it will validate using javascript and show the error instantly. Therefore it saves more time and improve the phpmyadmin interface as well. 
In future validating the necessary fields using javascript will provide an easy and speedy access to all the users. 
I have attached the modified file that I'm using now and hope it will be useful for others as well.it also can be enhanced more..  Its just my opinion. If it is wrong please kindly forgive me.

        <title>Export to target version - ID: 1508974</title>
        <detail>I do a lot of work exporting and importing data  
between various versions of MySQL.  Currently when  
you export the data from say a MySQL 4.1 or 5.0, and  
try and import that into MySQL 4.0, there are errors  
in the dump syntax because phpMyAdmin assumes the  
import server is running the same version of MySQL as  
the export server. 
 
The primary issues I consistenly come across is the  
export setting flags like TIMESTAMP columns  
defaulting to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, which doesn't exist  
under MySQL 4.0, nor does setting the default  
charater set to latin1.  I have to manually clean the  
dump file every time before I can import it. 
 
Can we have another option on the export interface  
for listing compatibility versions?  eg. Export as  
compatible with version = 4.1, etc 
 
This would save a lot time researching on my part to  
figure out where all the differences are in the dump  
formats.</detail>

thus, the eye would catch easily, which table you are editing at the moment.</detail>

If you delete a database you'll get a warning. OK. If you delete a user and select to delete its database you won't get any warning! With one wrong click everything is gone! The Interface is missleading because the button is located in the near of the question to delete the user. It is very easy to mix these both options. Please implement another question before deleting the database this way!

        <title>QueryFrameJS configures too much of the Query Frame behavior - ID: 1311856</title>
        <detail>Hi! 
 
   phpMyAdmin is highly configurable, which is one more 
reason many people like it so much. 
   This post is about the QueryFrameJS option. 
   If it is TRUE, it does two (from user's point of 
view) things: 
 - first, it makes phpMyAdmin to open new window when I 
select the link [Edit] bellow the just-executed SQL 
query. This is behavior I dislike. 
 - second, it makes the SQL link from the left frame 
to open a new window where I can find the History 
tab. This is feature I like. 
 
  So, if I want to make phpMyAdmin to edit current 
query in the same frame in which it displayed the 
result, and also keep the History page in the 
QueryWindow, I cannot achieve it with current 
configuration settings. 
  My suggestion, if technically achievable, is to 
separate the configuration settings. So one can keep 
the History tab in SQL Query window and also activate 
the  on-place query editing (in the  right frame). 
 
P.S.  &quot;QueryFrame&quot; configuration setting enables 
right-frame query editing, but disables the SQL link in 
the left frame :( 
 
P.S.S I searched the Features for similar one to avoid 
duplicates, couldn't find any.</detail>

        <detail>First of all, great new theme :) 
 
Would it be possible to add a config option to be able to disable the mootools popup used when creating a new table, and instead, just refresh the screen as it used to do with old versions? 
We usually create tables with over 10 columns, and on smaller screens we can't resize the popup enough to make it look 'nice' and functional enough. 
 
We usually already did have scroll bars for this, but the fact the res is just 1280x1024, causes more loss of overview now.</detail>

How about next and previous buttons while editing a  
record? A new radion button which allows you to move  
to the next record after updating. This would make  
editing multiple records so much easier. Selected  
records could also be edited by using checkboxes,  
similar to the new feature of deleting multiple rows in  
browse.

        <detail>Hello, 
 
I'd like to add to PhpMyAdmin a small correction. 
 
Every time when a new version of PMA will appear,

for his own parameters. 
 
But now, when a &quot;config.default.php&quot; file exist, I propose  
that &quot;config.inc.php&quot; file could look f.e. like in the  
attached file. 
 
I think it's a better solution to set only own parameters  
in &quot;config.inc.php&quot; file, and the rest params can be  
include from &quot;config.default.php&quot; file.</detail>

        <detail>Hi Friends, 
 
My website is configured to use the mysql asp.net providers (membership, profile, role) in the MySql database. I tested it on my local machine as localhost and it does work. However, after having copied my site to the remote server it does not recognise the mysql providers. I assume that the server is not configured properly or I have to make some adjustment. On the phpMyAdmin page I see no option/clue as to how to configue the mysql providers in order to use them. 
 
Any help is grately appreciated,

        <title>(semi-)Automatically adding PMA related tables - ID: 886784</title>
        <detail>In line with my other suggestion (for when there are outright errors)  
I'd like to see a configuration page for PMA that either sets up or  
helps to set up the database tables for the various features of PMA. 
 
For example, I enable bookmarks in config.inc.php but haven't added  
the appropriate table. PMA could easily provide the queries needed to  
generate the table(s). And even execute them. 
 
So... when there are features actived that need tables and the  
specified tables don't exist PMA would just present the user with some  
options (e.g. 'Create table for bookmarks', 'Show query for creating  
bookmark table', etc.). 
 
It's nice to have all the queries in the documentation, but why not  
where it's really useful?

        <detail>Goal: import/export may require more memory than other  
scripts. This patch enables more memory for these two  
scripts only (related to $cfg['ExecTimeLimit']) 
 
Affected scripts: 
+ config.inc.php /* $Id: config.default.php,v 2.20.2.1  
2005/11/23 10:34:32 nijel Exp $ */ 
+ import.php /* $Id: import.php,v 2.10 2005/11/18

+ export.php /* $Id: export.php,v 2.30 2005/11/18  
12:50:49 cybot_tm Exp $ */ 
 
 
Changes based on version 2.7.0: 
=============================== 
 
1) config.inc.php - add after &quot;$cfg['ExecTimeLimit']&quot;: 
$cfg['MemoryLimit']		        = '16M'; //  
memory_limit for import.php and export.php 
 
2) import.php - replace: 
OLD: @set_time_limit($cfg['ExecTimeLimit']); 
NEW: 
if(!get_cfg_var('safe_mode')){ 
	set_time_limit($cfg['ExecTimeLimit']); 
	ini_set('memory_limit', $cfg['MemoryLimit']); 
} 
 
3) export.php - replace: 
OLD: 
/** 
 * Increase time limit for script execution and  
initializes some variables 
 */ 
@set_time_limit($cfg['ExecTimeLimit']); 
 
NEW: 
/**

Hi list, 
in order to get a backup of my mysql, when i wasn't  
able to get through  
to my mysqldump, i've written a patch to today's mysql  
cvs download  
(which says it's a 2.23?? is that okay?). 
 
My lines are marked with //js. In tbl_dump.php i had to  
move lots of code into a new function,  
buildDBDump($showDropCreateDatabase); since i  
need this in a while-loop when dumping all dbs and in a  
if when dumping just one db's content. 
 
i haven't participated in this list before and so  i  
don't know if this functionality was left out on  
purpose. if so, please drop me a line. 
 
In main.php, i used $strViewDumpDB &amp;quot;View dump (schema)  
of database&amp;quot;  
instead of creating a &amp;quot;View dump (schema) of all  
databases&amp;quot; which would  
have been correct but had introduced a new variable to  
translate into  
other languages. 
 
hope the changes are somehow valuable... 
regards

        <title>(in 2.7.0) OPTIMAL MY.INI VALUES - ID: 1290830</title>
        <detail>Hello Developers ! 
 
The mysql server runtime status sheet should include a  
function to determine the best my.ini values which can  
be calculated (est.).  
 
eg. runtime information: 
 
Key read requests   278696   
Key reads   5121   
Key write requests   32878   
Key writes   18085   
 
So if someone knows about finetuning mysql, the  
recommended values are divide the value of key_read by  
the value of key_reads_requests - this should be less  
than 0.01. same for writes. 
 
So phpmyadmin should show these and other values  
maybe in other color (red) to give some hints for better  
my.ini settings.</detail>

        <title>__TABLE__ not getting replaced in db export - ID: 760432</title>
        <detail>Problem: When exporting a single table from the 
database export section phpMyAdmin should replace 
__TABLE__ with the proper table name. 
 
How To: Go to the Database export page (not the table 
export page). Select a single table, select &amp;quot;Save as 
file&amp;quot; and type in __TABLE__ in the &amp;quot;File name template&amp;quot; 
field. Then click Go. 
Current Behaviour: the file name prompted for download 
is __TABLE__ instead of the name of the table.sql 
 
Desired Behaviour: when exporting a single table if the 
filename contains __TABLE__ it should be replaced by 
the selected table name. 
 
Code pointer: 
$Id: export.php3,v 1.2 2003/06/14 08:03:33 nijel Exp $ 
line 141 should be made similar to 148. 
 
phpMyAdmin - 2.5.2-dev 
PHP - 4.3.2 
MySQL - 4.0

        <title>Store frequently used queries. - ID: 1893577</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
  working on a project I've been in the situation of use a lot of times in few minutes the same queries in a database. 
 
  So I've created myself a small program that execute those queries. 
 
  But I thought that it could be useful to have maybe a page database-related (maybe in the same way designer works, using the phpmyadmin database) where it could be stored some queries and executed directly from there. 
 
  Thanks in advance, even if you don't think that this is a good idea ;)

        <title>Shortlink support - ID: 3511561</title>
        <detail>It would be handy to have shortlink support for queries.  The closest thing available now is creating a bookmarked query.  For convenience of IM'ing/emailing results around it'd be nice to be able to send a link for the result set you were looking at.  To clarify I'm not looking for a way to cache the state of a resultset at any certain point in time; just a direct phpmyadmin link with the query I want to send.</detail>

        <title>query printing - ID: 507270</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
It would be nice to have better ability to print  
queries. 
Because at this time if row have a lot of columns,  
only data which fits to page width can be printed,  
rest of displayed data is being cut. It would be nice  
to be able to print the data from each row on the  
separate page.  
For example: Query displays 45 rows. Print all of this  
rows on separate pages each, in vertical view format.  
 
Thank you.

        <title>Mininum password length - ID: 802105</title>
        <detail>Hi 
 
Users are allowed to change their mysql passwords 
through phpmyadmin (if enabled in config-file) but I 
would like to set minimum length for new password. 
MySQL itself doesn't set length restrictions for 
passwords but administrators could enforce users to use 
longer password for security reasons. 
 
There could be parameter in config-file for password 
lengths: 
$cfg['PasswordLength'] = 8 // only passwords &amp;gt;= 8 
characters are allowed, -1 = no length restriction

        <title>SWF for relation view - ID: 1185964</title>
        <detail>I would like suggest to develope a plugin for 
phpmyadmin for relational databases like the 
PDF-generation plugin. 
 
possible advantages over PDF-plugin:  
- WYSIWYG, automatic drawing of relation lines while 
layouting the tables. 
- Scalable 
- interactive (e.g. show table or field comments or 
content on mouseover etc.) 
- expand, collapse table details 
 
There are more than one way to reach the aim: 
 
A. -  
Make a prebuild SWF for phpmyadmin that loads a 
XML-file which is send by phpmyadmin. The XML contains 
all informations about tablefields,and relations, and 
the last layoutpositions of your tables. (like the 
pdfconfig has) 
Some little ActionScript parse the XML, at first open 
layout the table and connect the relation fields by 
lines using a sweet layout/routing algorithm (give 
possibility to customize by drag/drop the lines by user) 
Let the user drag/drop the tables. Lines are repainted 
automatically following the tables when dragged. 
Save your changes for the next time you open the swf 
generation config. Because the Data is separated from 
Layoutview, the SWF is even themeable. 
 
This variant requires Flash &gt;= 5, but the 
phpmyadminuser need no flashgeneration library at all. 
 
B. Do all the magic in PHP/whateverlanguage and 
generate the SWF complete on server using an 
swfgeneration library ('ming' or some other) Even 
Flash4 would be sufficient for this variant, but 
requires the minglibrary in PHP. 
 
C. Like A, but using GET/POSTvariables. But XML is 
better and easier to handle in Flash.

&quot;The additional features for working with linked tables have been deactivated. To find out why click here.&quot;, which is nice 
 
but on that page, it only checks the variables, and there is no helpful info how to solve it fast. only the link to the documentation, which is quite big. 
 
there should be this sentence on the top: 
 
To enable the advanced features, you have to configure the variables in your config file:  
1. create the needed tables with the script/create_tables.sql 
2. create a pma user and give access to that tables 
3. create a config.inc.php like config.sample.inc.php in the main directory of PMA 
4. uncomment the lines for the advanced features there.</detail>

        <title>(ok 3.5) Copy set of tables to new name pattern - ID: 1863198</title>
        <detail>Right now I can copy each table individually to a new name, but it requires me to go to every table in the database to do this operation.  It would be much easier if there was a way to batch copy tables to a new table prefix. 
 
For example if I had a DB that look like 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_foo_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_bar_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_doh_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_ray_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_wii_table 
 
if there was a a pull down option to copy in the &quot;with selected&quot; pull down in the database screen and a text box to indicate the new prefix to add on (or more elaborately a regex if desired) such that if I had &quot;s/^my_app/my_test/&quot; it would then copy the table structure and contents for each table so that the new db would look like: 
 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_foo_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_bar_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_doh_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_ray_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_app_wii_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_test_foo_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_test_bar_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_test_doh_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_test_ray_table 
DB_MY_DB.my_test_wii_table</detail>

        <title>(in 2.6.0) Import of old config files needs to be documented - ID: 968177</title>
        <detail>It's getting tedious to diff the config.inc.php file 
every time I update PMA. I maintain a copy of PMA on 
half a dozen different servers, and I frequently update 
to the latest CVS version on my development machine, so 
I spend a considerable amount of time diffing the old 
and new config.inc files. 
 
I'm trying out a PHP/MySQL-based bug tracker called 
Mantis (http://www.mantisbt.org/) whose configuration 
strategy I like better. It works like this: they have a 
config.defaults file in their distribution, containing 
default values for all configurable options. Then they 
include a suggested config.inc file, including just the 
configuration options that must be changed (like server 
addresses and passwords and admin email addresses). 
Values that are defined in the config.inc override 
values in the config.defaults file. 
 
This has an advantage over the PMA strategy -- when 
updating, the user can simply copy their config.inc 
from the old distribution to the new one. Any new 
options that became available get assigned to 
appropriate default values through the config.defaults 
file. 
 
There should ideally be a way for PMA to indicate to 
the admin when new configurable options become 
available. But maybe that's something best left for 
when PMA has a way to update itself via a command-line 
script or via the web interface. I believe there's 
another feature request out on that.</detail>

        <title>GSoC jQuery added to interface - ID: 2979635</title>
        <detail>I will use jQuery to essentially make 90% of the administration ajax-style so that not as many reloads will have to occur throughout the site. Speed is quite a problem in phpMyAdmin at the moment, especially while running locally (at least on my computer). I am proposing not only switching the top navigation menu over to jQuery, but also editing table structures, searching tables, building queries, inserting new fields and new rows, and much more.  
 
I will also allow the site to degrade nicely if a user does not have javascript enabled. 
 
I am planning on converting the following features to AJAX-style coding: 
Top Navigation Bar 
Adding Fields to tables 
Validating the inserted fields 
Inserting/updating rows in tables 
Search Function 
Query Builder Function 
primary/unique/index keys 
Empty/Drop/Delete 
 
Any extra suggestions?</detail>

        <title>automatic date and number formatting - ID: 568532</title>
        <detail>i'd like to do something that allows the user to choose  
his usual way of showing date,time and numbers and  
then have all output formatted this way, and also  
userinput accepted in this format. 
=&amp;gt; you once choose from a select that you use date  
as 'dd.mm.yyyy' so you can enter it like this and it will  
be formatted to 'yyyy-mm-dd' to be entered in the db  
without the user having to think about it. 
2 problems: 
First i think this should possibly wait until every user is  
able to choose this himself using db-config? 
Second, with the format yyyy-mm-dd i can easily search  
for everything within may 2002 using like '2002-05-%', if  
the user wants to use 'dd.mm.yyyy' formatting he would  
have to say '%.mm.yyyy' and i would have to change  
this to 'yyyy-mm-%'. it is possible, it can be done easily  
and fast, the problem is only: will it be more or less  
easy to understand than just having the user use  
mysqls internal dateformat?</detail>

        <title>(ok 2.9.0) Report error if no $i++ in config.inc.php - ID: 1451521</title>
        <detail>So some users who aren't familiar with the concept of  
an array and needing to have $i=0; $i++; in  
config.inc.php are having problems logging in because  
PMA silently ignores their username, password, etc. in  
config.inc.php (since it's not set for a server[1]). 
 
It should be possible to detect if they missed it,  
(perhaps by seeing if servers[0] is set?) and  
displaying an error message. Yeah, I know it should be  
figured out from reading the docs and looking at the  
default config file, but I guess the &quot;only copy values  
you want to override the defaults&quot; part gets them or  
something. Is there something that can be done about  
this?</detail>

        <title>SYSDATE() as default for DATETIME fields - ID: 545694</title>
        <detail>Whilst looking for a way to automatically put a  
timestamp against when a field was inserted I happened  
to put SYSDATE() in the default box when inserting a  
new field of type DATETIME into a table. To my shock  
this actually works! The new field contains the  
current date and time.  
 
However, looking at the table using phpMyAdmin reveals  
no evidence of this default value, just '0000-00-00  
00:00' in the default column. Although the SYSDATE()  
works it is invisible in the default column. It would  
be good to change this and also give the user a drop- 
down list box or such to allow this to be entered  
without knowing exactly what to type. 
 
There are many cases when an automatic timestamp on  
when a record is entered is useful. It would be a  
useful feature of phpMyAdmin to be able to control  
this functionality.

        <title>Centralized PMA database - ID: 3485898</title>
        <detail>I have several slaves I would like to setup a PMA interface for and enable extra features such as history and bookmarks stored in the PMA db.  Currently I can only specify a database to house that information; it defaults to the same server as that it's browsing.  This presents a couple problems 
 
1. I cannot read my slaves in read -only mode as the pma user needs to write to this meta db 
2. I have to create all these superfluous databases around my slaves, cluttering things up, and generally making me sad.   
 
I'd like to be able to specify a secondary server for the pmadb and have this shared db hold information for all the hosts I configure.</detail>

        <title>PMA not using SET NAMES on Custom Collation / Charset - ID: 2801532</title>
        <detail>Hello all, 
 
A quick thank you for all the awesome work on this project throughout the years :-) 
 
I was having issues exporting data from one machine to another via PMA, UTF-8 chars were turning to ??? and whatnot. 
 
I did some poking around and found that only a few of the character_set_% variables were being set, and character_set_results in particular wasn't changing at all [it was stuck as utf8 even though my collation was latin1], no matter which collation / charset I set PMA to. 
 
My website connects using latin1, for backwards compatibility, so I use: SET NAMES 'latin1' 
 
PMA doesn't use SET NAMES when a user collation is specified, only when the user has not specified a collation... maybe it should? 
 
I changed ./libraries/database_interface.lib.php ~ line 853 to: 
#    	PMA_DBI_query(&quot;SET CHARACTER SET 'utf8';&quot;, $link, PMA_DBI_QUERY_STORE); 
#        $mysql_charset = explode('_', $GLOBALS['collation_connection']); 
#        PMA_DBI_query(&quot;SET collation_connection = '&quot; . PMA_sqlAddslashes($GLOBALS['collation_connection']) . &quot;';&quot;, $link, PMA_DBI_QUERY_STORE); 
$mysql_charset = explode('_', $GLOBALS['collation_connection']); 
PMA_DBI_query(&quot;SET NAMES '&quot; . $mysql_charset[0] . &quot;' COLLATE '&quot; . $GLOBALS['collation_connection'] . &quot;';&quot;, $link, PMA_DBI_QUERY_STORE); 
 
... and it worked like a charm :-) 
 
I understand this is for the CONNECTION collation, but maybe there should be a better way to control all the character_set_% charsets / collations, like through through SET NAMES.</detail>

        <detail>Hi- 
 
I have a pretty simple request for the cookie auth method:  A pref  
to customize expiration time of the cookies.  Currently, the  
password cookie expires when the browser is closed. 
 
Some of us use PMA in a secure, intranet environment with  
multiple servers and want the login to be valid for a fixed time. 
 
So how about adding a pref allowing us to set that time?  It took  
me about 30 seconds to customize line 626 of cookie.auth.lib.php  
but others might find this useful. 
 
Thanks.</detail>

        <detail>Our e-commerce site was hacked 8 times in 7 days by  
the Arabian Fighter Hackerz who planted malicious  
code in our MySQL database. 
 
Every web server related software producer should  
immediately rewrite code so that any PHP script that  
contains global variables, inconsistent data types and  
so forth is rejected and returns an error message 404. 
 
I have asked Apache.Org to rewrite Mod_PHP so that  
their web server will not accept any PHP script written  
with undeclared variables and/or with variables that have  
not been set with an initial value. 
 
99% of the successful hacker page hijacks are now  
carried out through PHP scripts written by developers  
who are too lazy to declare and initialize variables.  You  
can protect MySQL by simply rejecting any such script.</detail>

        <title>config.inc: default database - ID: 1027330</title>
        <detail>One variable I'd like to see included in pma's 
config.inc is $cfg['Servers'][$i]['default_db'] for 
setting the default database to select after 
authentication, versus opening no database, and 
starting with the pma front page. 
 
That would be helpful, since most of the time, I am 
accessing the same database, and it would save an 
additional step to not have to select it.  It's also 
not a rehash of $cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'], since I 
don't want to use only one (or more) databases. 
 
Thanks guys!

        <title>Status page to contain comparable values - ID: 1739615</title>
        <detail>File server_status.php is invoked from pressing &quot;Status&quot; for your server. 
 
This is a great tool for pin pointing potential problems with your applications - but I find myself missing a simple feature on the page. 
 
Every once in a while I go there to see if some numbers are too high - meaning I may have code leaking SQL wise. 
 
It is easily spotted by looking at Handler_read_rnd and Handler_read_rnd_next for example. 
 
What I keep finding myself doing is calculating how many minutes of uptime I have, and divide the above mentioned numbers with this amount of minutes... only to get a comparable number. 
 
Sometimes I read values after 24 hours - sometimes after 14 days. Having a number &quot;per minute&quot; would make a lot of sense here. Not only for the 2 I mentioned - but for a lot of values on the status page. 
 
I haven't looked at the PHP code, but I'm pretty sure this is an easy task as all numbers already exist - it's just a matter of a few arithmetic operations :)</detail>

        <title>(in 2.7.0) Class C/B/A additions to IP Address Shortcuts - ID: 1022831</title>
        <detail>This is a very handy addition to the ip address 
restriction capabilities, where you need to deploy 
phpmyadmin remotely, with a basic level of security &amp; 
usability, but are not sure of the remote IP address. 
 
The following modifications to 
libraries/ip_allow_deny.lib.php allow you to specify 
'localC / localB / localA' as ip address aliases within 
the config file AllowDeny setting: 
 
Old: 
    // copy rule database 
    $rules     = $cfg['Server']['AllowDeny']['rules']; 
 
    $shortcuts = array( 
        'all'       =&gt; '0.0.0.0/0', 
        'localhost' =&gt; '127.0.0.1/8' 
    ); 
 
New: 
    $rules     = $cfg['Server']['AllowDeny']['rules']; 
 
 
    $serveraddr=$_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR']; 
 
 
    // lookup table for some name shortcuts 
    $shortcuts = array( 
        'all'       =&gt; '0.0.0.0/0', 
        'localhost' =&gt; '127.0.0.1/8', 
        'localC' =&gt; &quot;$serveraddr/24&quot;, 
        'localB' =&gt; &quot;$serveraddr/16&quot;, 
        'localA' =&gt; &quot;$serveraddr/8&quot; 
    ); 
 
 
This will allow you to do something like this in the 
config file: 
 
# Allow from localhost, the local class C, and 
non-routable addresses 
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] = 
array(&quot;allow % from localhost&quot;,&quot;allow % from 
localC&quot;,&quot;allow % from 10.0.0.1/8&quot;,&quot;allow % from 
192.168.0.1/16&quot;);</detail>

we all know that the OpenDocument format is going to

there should be an OpenDocument export in phpMyAdmin, too. 
 
Because there already is a XML export in phpMyAdmin and 
exporting an example MySQL table with OpenOffice Base 
as CSV document is a matter of seconds, it should be 
not too hard.

        <detail>actually the &amp;quot;upload textfile into database&amp;quot;

Could this value be increased ? 
Also, there's no error message when the file is  
larger, it just reloads the page and nothing else  
happens.</detail>

A similar feature is needed for geometry columns. 
 
MySQL can convert them to WKT/WKB format using AsText() and AsBinary(). 
MySQL can convert the data back using GeomFromText() and GeomFromWKB().</detail>

        <title>ability to merge tables with the same names - ID: 1111045</title>
        <detail>the ability to merge an sql dump into a database and if  
the same names appear it will add (ALTER) any fields  
from the dump that arn't in the database 
 
REASON: 
im working on a new system designing at work and at  
home - i could work on a database online, but while im  
working on the database im not thinking about security  
(i.e who can remember password when trying to code  
fast so i just use null passwords) plus the PHP isn't  
online (makes it easier to code)  so any database is in  
the open</detail>

        <title>Add a link by MySQL-Error #1062 - Duplicate entry - ID: 1036254</title>
        <detail>Hi, 
 
if you want to make a field in a table unique, but you 
have an duplicate entry this error is shown: 
SQL-query: 
ALTER TABLE `xyz` ADD UNIQUE ( 
`fieldxyz` 
) 
MySQL said: Documentation 
#1062 - Duplicate entry 'F**K' for key 2  
 
So, then it would be nice, if there were a link, which 
makes a 
&quot;SELECT * FROM `xyz` WHERE `fieldxyz` LIKE 'F**K'&quot;. 
Because that is much more quicklier than do that by 
hand, and i guess this would be used very often. 
 
Thanks for your excellent job</detail>

        <title>(ok 3.4) Visual Programming feature for SQL queries - ID: 2981729</title>
        <detail>I would like to have a better code editor for the SQL command execution.Or it would be better to have commonly used command ,Such as INSERT , DELETE to be used as visual Programming,(i.e someone can write a query using a graphical menu). 
 
So for a novice it would be fun and easy to understand,And for an expert we can provide custom menu which can build advanced queries customizing those simple queries easily. 
 
This would be an improvement on the interface for the prevailing feature.</detail>

        <title>Improve popup window titles (query window, theme selector) - ID: 1207421</title>
        <detail>The title of the query window is always &quot;phpMyAdmin&quot;. 
The title of the theme selection popup window is 
&quot;phpMyAdmin - 2.6.3-dev&quot;. It would be nice if this could 
be standardized. It would be very nice if both of these 
windows could work like the main window with regard to 
$cfg['ShowHttpHostTitle'] and $cfg['SetHttpHostTitle']. 
 
In the course of implementing this request, the 
following can also be addressed: There seems to be a lot 
of duplicated code between themes.php and 
header_meta_style.inc.php. I'm thinking themes.php 
should probably be able to use header_meta_style.inc.php. 
 
I'm thinking probably header_meta_style.inc.php's title 
tag can be augmented with $cfg['SetHttpHostTitle'] and 
that would then take care of it.</detail>

        <title>show edit links based on user permission - ID: 558737</title>
        <detail>Added a new function, PMA_isGrantValid($grant,  
$table), which checks to see if the current user has  
permissions to perform edit, update, etc. before  
showing the appropriate link for Edit or Update on  
the table browse and edit pages. Thus, if a user  
does not have permission to Update, the update  
link will not show when browsing data in a table. 
 
Note: I have not tried to apply these changes to the  
table properties page. Since this page is going  
through some major changes (as of mid-May  
2002), I will wait on this.

        <title>Inter-server operability. - ID: 467757</title>
        <detail>I run 2 servers on phpMyAdmin. I would like to be able  
to move/copy/update databases and tables from one  
server to the other: 
 
Scenario 1: 
 
I want to move/copy an entire database with/without  
its contents from server A to server B and vice-versa. 
 
Scenario 2: 
 
I want to move/copy an entire table with/without its  
contents from server A to server B, and vice-versa. 
 
Scenario 3: 
 
I have 2 development servers with similar structures  
but not identical data. I want to be able to move/copy  
records from server A to server B, and vice-versa. 
 
Scenario 4:  
 
Refer Scenario 3. I would like a synchronization  
feature also, meaning that a table must draw data from  
another (similar) table on another server, and make  
the records look identical. 
 
Quite a demand. Thanks for a GREAT application!</detail>

        <title>(in 2.5.2) Export multi-table SELECT results - ID: 684804</title>
        <detail>It is currently (2.4.0rc1) not possible to do exports on  
SELECTS with more than one table. 
 
I understand why this must be for the SQL-generating  
exports (if fields are from more than one table), but the  
other exports types work just fine - so shouldn't the  
control be made in tbl_properties_export instead and  
then disable just the SQL-exports if multi-table?</detail>

        <detail>Good day, 
 
I would like to inform phpmyadmin support : 
 
When i create a column with space at the end of column  
name, after when i query, there is an error on  
query...and it is difficult to find the error. 
 
I think phpmyadmin should do a &amp;quot;TRIM()&amp;quot; function and  
delete space when it create a new column name 
 
Please, inform phpmyadmin support to correct this  
problem

        <title>[config] Storing Server Configuration in Database - ID: 485311</title>
        <detail>Recieved from Roland Knall (roland_dot_knall at  
web_dot_de): 
 
Hi Everyone 
 
First I want to excuse if this task has already been  
discussed. I do not want to produce overhead ;-) 
 
I am working with PHP and MySQL all day long, and have  
to work with several customer databases. Therefore I  
have every database in the config file. 
Adding a new database is really inconvinient, and I  
simply hate the way it is done. Not because it is not  
useful, but simply because I have to leave the Browser  
window. After adding a 6th database this morning, I  
decided to do something against it. Here is what I  
have done: 
 
The Database configurations are being stored in a  
database table. In the config.inc.php the $cfgServer  
entries have been removed, instead some $cfgDBServer  
entries have been written, to select the database in  
use. 
Adv_Auth entries can either be entered globally by  
setting 
    $cfgDBServer[&amp;quot;adv_auth&amp;quot;] 
or database specific by setting the corresponding  
database entry. 
 
libraries/common.lib.php has been expanded by adding a  
short (starting at about line 300 ) If clause which  
checks for $cfgDBServers being TRUE, unsetting  
$cfgServer if this is the case, and reading the  
entries from the Database table. Therefore existing  
configurations have to be proted to the database, I  
guess you could uncomment the unset($cfgServers)  
statement without any problems, this was simply not  
what I wanted it to do. 
 
Localization in the error messages is not being done  
by now, the errors occur in english. 
 
I append the additions to common.lib.php  and  
config.inc.php as diff against the current Release  
Candidate ( 2.2.2-rc1 ) version. I do not know if it 
works against CVS, but should do so without any  
problems. Keep me posted, if it works and what you  
think of it.

phpmyadmin is a good software ... but it's a hell

of security issues: 
Maybe it is a contest between you and Microsoft? 
I think it's time to audit code and track all security 
problem in phpmyadmin before add anything else. 
 
 
Hope it would be done ... :)

it would be a big help to have a possibility to define the  
default setting of the character code selection for the  
export destiniation file ('charset_of_file') when you have  
activated $cfg['AllowAnywhereRecoding'], thus to avoid  
that you need to always select the requested code on  
every export.

        <title>(ok 3.4) Column highlight in table view - ID: 3111455</title>
        <detail>Is it possible to allow columns to be highlighted when clicking on column headings, in a similar way to how rows are currently highlighted? 
This would be handy where there are multiple columns of numbers, bits or enums with the same values, next to each other and you are only interested in one of them. 
 
For example, we have a table with five Enum Yes/No columns next to each other and I may just be interested in one or two of them, as it is currently, it can be easy to lose track of which column you need to be looking at when flipping between your code and the database, which means scrolling back up to the column headings to find the right columns again. 
 
I have seen examples of this working with mouseover and mouseout, so it should be possible to change this to an onclick event instead 
This seems to be a good way of doing it, it does however require JQuery: http://css-tricks.com/row-and-column-highlighting/

        <title>Export: catch MySQL error messages - ID: 1396900</title>
        <detail>so here is what happened: 
 
i was coding a fulltext search for a webpage that was 
supposed to get results from a specific table using the 
search conditions sent via GET. the thing itself works 
well with other tables (ive used methods described on 
http://www.phpfreaks.com/tutorials/129/2.php) but as i 
got to one specific, it didnt return any results even 
tho it should (logically). so i opened up my 
localhost-based PMA and went to check the table. first 
thing i wanted to do was recreating the fulltext index 
for that table. but as i was removing the old one, i 
got MySQL error #1005 with &quot;cant create table 
#sql_something&quot;.  
then i tried to Repair Table but i got MySQL error 
#1016 with &quot;cant open file tablename.MYI&quot; instead. 
since then, this error appears every time i try to 
access this table from the tables list, with no table 
data displayed. 
the last thing i tried to do was exporting the database 
structure and rebuild the specific table from scratch. 
but even tho the database structure went ok (without 
errors displayed), after i opened up the exported .sql 
file, i noticed that instead of the specific table 
structure, the file contained the xhtml code that is 
produced by PMA when error occurs. 
now im completely clueless.. i do have a backup of the 
whole database, but id like to know what/where the 
problem is, in case it appears again in the future. 
 
ideas? 
thanks in advance</detail>

        <title>(Inter.) Show DB with accessible tables - ID: 565555</title>
        <detail>Basically an interface improvement I think others may find useful is when a user has permissions to  
access specific tables in a database, but not the others, to display the database (and if possible) with  
only the accessible tables displayed. 
 
ex: Database_X has 20 tables, but 'userx' has all priveleges to 8 of those.  In the column showing the  
databases, show: &amp;quot;Database_X (8)&amp;quot;.  This way allowing them to browse those 8 tables without seeing or  
accessing the other 12 tables.  I can access them still in phpMyAdmin, takes a little work for lower  
tech's/users who aren't that familiar with phpMyAdmin or MySQL.</detail>

        <detail>I'd like phpmyadmin to have the ability for me to select two different DBS on 2 different connections and have phpmyadmin scan both and diplay a split 'source db' and 'target db' view of both with tables, fieldnames and types listed and the differences. highlighted. In that view I'd like a widget with a list of auto-generated or ordered structure-sync, type-sync and data-sync queries which I can select/deselect in a column of checkboxes and then execute the selected ones via a button in order to sync the DB parts I'd like to sync. ... I find this the most usefull feature of the closed source tool Navicat over phpmyadmin. However, their Linux version is a disgrace and I'd appreciate this feature as an attractive addition to phpmyadmin.

  For a demonstration, it might be nice to have the

        <title>Compound-statements when Creating Event - ID: 3383845</title>
        <detail>It is not possible to use compound-statement syntax (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/sql-syntax-compound-statements.html) in the 'DEFINITION' field of &quot;Create Event&quot; form of the phpMyAdmin version 3.5.0-dev. 
 
There should be another field called 'delimiter' which would allow us to change the default (semicolon) delimiter to something else. This kind of field is already implemented in the 'SQL' tab for manual SQL statements. 
 
I think though, it'd be even nicer if the phpMyAdmin identifies an 'END' after a semi-colon and automatically change the delimiter before executing the query and add it just after the 'END'. I know there might be an issue if the user enter the chosen (by pMA dev team) delimiter, which would terminate the query before it should. However, that can be prevented by choosing a very uncommon character (or a set of them) as delimiter and searching for them before executing the query. 
 
Now, a tiny bug: the link which calls the form is 'add event' but the form is called 'create event'. In order to be coherent to the original SQL statement (CREATE EVENT) I would change the 'Add Event' link to 'Create Event' and then it's all standardized. 
 
That's all for now; congratulations to all developers involved in this amazing project and I hope I helped somehow.

        <title>Show &quot;Overhead&quot; with same precision for all tables - ID: 3046635</title>
        <detail>I would like to see the Overhead column (when viewing the list of all tables) be shown using ONE precision - that is, all in K-bytes, for example. 
 
The reason is that, when scanning down that column to find tables that need attention, you are looking for large numbers.  But a table with 985.8 KiB catches the eye more readily than a table with 2.1 GiB. 
 
Also, I don't really get the inclusion of the &quot;i&quot; in the above designations.  I mean sure, it makes sense with Kilobytes and Gigabytes - but it really doesn't match Megabytes at all.  I think most people are used to seeing KB, MB, and GB.  The extra &quot;i&quot; is not really needed.</detail>

This way, I can create my database on two machines,  
mark the place in time on the one machine, then  
periodically merge over the &amp;quot;changes&amp;quot; onto my other  
machine.  Sort of like a simple form of replication but

Lets face it. The frameset of phpmyadmin is not pretty. 
 
How many websites nowadays do you find that uses framesets? 
What is the main reason there are so few? 
 
I suggest a switch to html5 with the nice  prefix. 
 
Sometimes, I want to shift-click a link in the right frame to get another window so I can have different tables in different windows. 
Then, the resulting window will miss the left frame. 
 
I also want to give positive feedback: thanks for phpmyadmin, a useful application that I use daily.</detail>

1) In view you can click on field and switch to  
another table/view. 
 
2) In view you can select which column to show in  
relations. And in foreign table you can select any  
field from view. 
 
3) Use of functions like CONCAT(field_one, '-',  
field_two) in relations to show data from related  
table. 
 
In example i have table of users, which have column  
for name and another column for surname. Now i can't

        <title>(ok 3.3) Server Synchronization - ID: 1756572</title>
        <detail>Hi to all open-source supporters :) 
 
Normally, for development I'm working on my local machine which is a mysql server, and then upload my work to actual web server when I'm finished with it, like everybody does. 
 
As a result, it's unavoidable to have some synchronization issues as a part of development-deployment circle. 
 
It was nice to have that phpMyAdmin could handle that. A new tab for synchronization might be added, which asks for mysql server address and user info, than connects to the remote server and does the SQL stuff... 
 
With current version, this can be done by  
1. Creating an SQL dump of up2date database 
2. Uploading and executing it on the another server's phpMyAdmin 
 
A &quot;one click synchronization&quot; would be really nice :)  
 
Then maybe we could save this &quot;remote servers' login data&quot; in a new local database (named phpMyAdmin) and then select one of pre-saved remote servers from a list, and click &quot;sync&quot;.</detail>

        <title>(in 2.6.1) Faster navigation in calendar - ID: 1090315</title>
        <detail>Steps to reproduce: 
 
1. Create a database 
2. Create a table say &quot;Employee&quot; under the database. 
3. Let one of the field in the table be date whose  
datatype is &quot;Date&quot; 
4. select the tab &quot;Insert&quot; to insert a row in that table. 
 
It opens a window where one of the field is date,  
besides which a calender icon is displayed. 
 
Click on the calender icon, it opens a new window which  
displays the  calender. 
 
Actual:  If the month in that is Dec, if we want to  
traverse to Jan we have to traverse step by step  
covering all the months.  
 
Expected: 
If we have a calender where we can directly select the  
month that would be more userfriendly.</detail>

        <title>(ok 2.11.8)Option for disabling version string on login page - ID: 1836335</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
due to rising amount of security patches (which I strongly support and be thankful for) I looked for a possibility to hide the version string of my current installation till I have got the time to upgrade. This way bots searching for vulnarable site would have it a lot harder to get the version string. 
 
I didn't find a way to do it just for the login site (I use cookie auth) without editing the core files (main.php or index.php, I guess). 
 
That's why I helped myself with editing the config.inc.php with the line: DEFINE('PMA_VERSION',''); which rewrites the version string applicationwide. 
 
Since I rather want to disable the string just on the login page (authenticated users should be able to see the version) I hereby file a feature request. 
 
Thank you,

        <detail>Could you swap the browse and structure tabs, as you've also swapped them in the nav bar? 
 
The tooltip for structure in the nav bar is browse: (4), while the tooltip for browse in it is just (4), I think this isn't right. 
 
If you add a primary key in the structure tab, it does drop primary key, add ... 
I'm not sure I prefer an existing primary key to be dropped automatically compared to getting an error. 
 
If I add a field and type in the default box, the default type isn't automatically switched to 'As defined:'. 
 
If I'm at the add field page and click on add (another) field, it detaults to 'As defined:' instead of the normal default of 'None'. 
 
I think auto increment should not be written as just A_I.

        <title>Run SQL query: Allow rollback for InnoDB tables - ID: 1420869</title>
        <detail>When running a DML statement such as 'update' in the 
SQL window it would be nice to see a checkbox that says 
&quot;Rollback updates/deletes when finished&quot;. This would be 
directly next to or below the existing checkbox &quot;Show 
this query here again&quot; 
 
This way you could run an update SQL and see the 
'affected rows' value without actually committing the 
transaction.  Seeing the 'affected rows' kinda 
indicates the relative success or failure of your DML. 
 
Of course, the ability to rollback or commit 
transaction only applies to InnoDB type tables...</detail>

id | name | access | owner

        <title>MySQL5 Trigger support (just SQL first) - ID: 1266951</title>
        <detail>It would be nice if the SQL parser would recognize 
&quot;CREATE TRIGGER&quot; sql statements and just change 
DELIMITER for this single statement to something not 
used in the statement, i.e. &quot;//&quot;. 
 
Example query: 
 
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_documents_forum_delete AFTER 
DELETE ON documents 
FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN 
  IF OLD.document_category_id=2 THEN 
    UPDATE forum_postings SET last_update=NOW() WHERE 
node_id=OLD.foreign_id; 
  END IF; 
END; 
 
 
phpMyAdmin should execute automatically before a 
&quot;CREATE TRIGGER&quot; statement: 
 
DELIMITER // 
 
and after the &quot;CREATE TRIGGER&quot; statement: 
 
// 
DELIMITER ; 
 
 
Conclusion: Each single &quot;CREATE TRIGGER&quot; statement 
should be surrounded automatically by two DELIMITER 
statements. 
The working example from the MySQL 5.0.11 command line is: 
 
DELIMITER // 
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_documents_forum_delete AFTER 
DELETE ON documents 
FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN 
  IF OLD.document_category_id=2 THEN 
    UPDATE forum_postings SET last_update=NOW() WHERE 
node_id=OLD.foreign_id; 
  END IF; 
END;// 
DELIMITER ; 
 
 
GUI support for triggers could be added later of course ;)

lengths:

        <title>(in 2.7.0) Disable &quot;Drop&quot; actions for the&quot;mysql&quot; db - ID: 1327514</title>
        <detail>Would it be possible to alter phpMyAdmin to catch &quot;DROP 
DATABASE mysql&quot; and politely tell the requester to 
reconsider? 
 
If you're anything like me, you're wondering why on 
Earth anyone would ever drop the mysql database.  I 
don't have an answer, but around here it happens about 
once a week. 
 
Our hosting customers are solely responsible for their 
own MySQL processes and have full admin rights on the 
process.  So, every week, someone goes through and 
purges all the database names they don't remember 
creating, starting with that obviously redundant one 
called &quot;mysql.&quot; 
 
MySQL will keep running with its cached user/table 
information until it is restarted, which is often 
months later.  By then, they have long since forgotten 
destroying their DB and blame us when it won't restart. 
 If they even believe us when we tell them that they 
did it to themselves, they blame us for letting them. 
 
We could modify our in-house copy of phpMyAdmin to do 
complain when people try this, but a fair number just 
grab their own and install it.  It would be really nice 
if there was a config option like: 
 
$allow_suicidal_behavior = false; 
 
And follow-up code like: 
 
if ($sql_query == &quot;DROP DATABASE 'mysql'&quot; &amp;&amp; 
!$allow_suicidal_behavior) { 
  ...  
  print(&quot;Please do not destroy your MySQL database.&quot;); 
  ... 
} 
 
and possibly: 
 
if ($database != &quot;mysql&quot; || $allow_suicidal_behavior) { 
  show_drop_option(); 
} 
 
to prevent the like-moths-to-flame attraction of the 
&quot;drop&quot; option for the &quot;mysql&quot; database in the first place. 
 
That way, if there's some legitimate reason for this, 
the user could change the default behavior to allow it. 
 
It's certainly debatable whether anyone who would 
remove the &quot;mysql&quot; database should be allowed 
administrator access to the server in the first place. 
 But not giving it to them is a no-sale. 
 
It's also doubtful whether phpMyAdmin is the best place 
to handle this.  But since it's so commonly offered to 
and used by people with fairly limited MySQL 
experience, it might save a lot of people a lot of 
hassle.  Thus, while not the *best* place, I think it 
would be a *good* place to handle it. 
 
Please give it some thought.</detail>

        <title>Navigation path - ID: 1161205</title>
        <detail>It would be very useful if there would be navigation path.  
For example, when you modify priviledges, you navigate  
through various pages; if you want to add priviledges to a  
second database for the same user, you must actually  
go to home and renavigate again restarting with  
priviledges=&gt;select user=&gt;select database=&gt;select  
priviledges=&gt;confirm. 
If you have all the navigation path above, you can  
immediatly go back to select a new database for the  
same user.  
The same thing can be done for all pages of  
phpmyadmin.</detail>

        <detail>Maybe this is already a feature, or possible using 
bookmarks (which I don't have access to, since my

great time saver if you could select a tab 
(browse/insert/operations) to be automatically 
displayed after you click on any table, especially browse. 
 
This would speed things up dramatically for me since I 
generally never work with the structure, but I always 
work with browse.  And when I'm reorganizing my tables, 
it would great to make the operations tab the default. 
 It would definitely help out those of us who don't 
have lightning fast load times.</detail>

        <detail>How to re-order a table by id? 
 
&amp;quot;Optimize Table&amp;quot; Consideration 
 
My first field is &amp;quot;id&amp;quot; which is an auto_increment primary field. 
 
Often users delete rows. 
I have one researcher who had previously deleted a number of fields. 
Now when the auto_increment creates a new field, the id numbering goes screwy! 
 
Number 16 for example has found itself at the beginning of her table, 
followed by 3,4,5,8,10 etc. 
 
It would be useful to have something in Optimise Table (or another function) 
to optimise a primary key, that is auto_incremented, to re-order the table. 
 
It would be useful to have an automatic way of re-numbering the complete table to re-nuimber  
from 1-1650 (number of fields I have).</detail>

Is it possible for you to add a breadcrumb when managing privileges. Here's my scenario, i set a privilege for a user, then set the database, then set the tables. after that if i want to add another one i have to click on localhost then privilege. is there a way to make a history/breadcrumb of my actions like &quot;privilege &gt; create user &gt; add db privilege &gt; add table privilege&quot; so that i can just click on those links like &quot;create user&quot; rather that going over the whole process again.

DROP TABLE IF EXIST t1;

Now I doing this: 
1. 'backup' PMA db,  
2. recreate my tables(databases). 
3. 'restore' PMA db 
 
Solution the best for me :): 
1.on the import page some options (checkbox), 
 No delete PMA records on drop table/database 
 And add some options to configuration file for default   
 value for the option(s). 
2.Comand Drop database without clearing PMA records. 
 And add some options to configuration file for default   
 value for the option(s). 
 
AND :) 
 
&quot;Multi add&quot; tables create schema page. 
For example prepare DB model with documentation for somebody (other team). 
I have 64 tables, and I would like create 6 schemas. 
First with all tables (nice schema :) ) 
And other detail schema. 
Adding all tables one by one take long time. 
 
 
phpMyAdmin is very good free tool for MySql and 
this two things is very helpful for deploying DB, creating documentation and testing complete creating SQL commands.

It would be great if I could include a customizable link in the left frame (above the 'Home' link) and/or on the home page (Maybe in a new category 'Links' below the category 'MySQL'). 
 
We would need to have (e.g.) two fields in the config.inc.php file:  
 
$cfgCustomLinkName = 'Back to ISP Homepage'; 
$cfgCustomLinkURL = '../'; 
 
That would help people going back from PMA to the ISP Homepage.

I needed to hide more than one database with phpmyadmin. So I try to replace the value $cfg['Servers'][$i]['hide_db'] = '' by an array, then by db names separated by commas.  
 
By checking the sources, this features is not implemented (yet hehe). 
 
The modification is easy to do, just one function in librairies/List_DataBase.class.php . Here is the code (I just added the part &quot;if is_array()&quot;) : 
 
[code] 
	function _checkHideDatabase() 
	{ 
		if (empty($GLOBALS['cfg']['Server']['hide_db'])) { 
			return; 
		} 
		foreach ($this-&gt;items as $key =&gt; $db) { 
			if(is_array($GLOBALS['cfg']['Server']['hide_db'])){ 
				foreach($GLOBALS['cfg']['Server']['hide_db'] as $hide){ 
					if (preg_match('/' . $hide . '/', $db)) { 
						unset($this-&gt;items[$key]); 
						break; 
					} 
				} 
			} 
			else{ 
				if (preg_match('/' . $GLOBALS['cfg']['Server']['hide_db'] . '/', $db)) { 
					unset($this-&gt;items[$key]); 
				} 
			} 
		} 
		// re-index values 
		$this-&gt;_need_to_reindex = true;

        <title>Can primary frame remember context for refresh - ID: 1012841</title>
        <detail>At the moment, when you hit the browser refresh button, 
phpMyAdmin loses the context you are in, and refreshes 
back to the default page. This is one of the major 
frustrations of the frames model, and the reason many 
people have argued for a non-frames version. I don't 
want to get into that religeous war over frames, but I 
feel that more people, including myself, would be happy 
if there was a way that context could be retained on a 
browser refresh, at least to the point of remembering 
which database was selected, ideally to remember where 
it was in a results page. 
 
I have tried to get into the habit of 
right-mouse-button refreshing the results frame, but 
keep forgetting.

        <detail>Triggers and Stored Procedures are for MySQL new features that have been implemented in version 5.0.2. 
It would be nice if phpmyadmin would allow us to maintain those just like you can maintain data/indexes etc... 
 
I know I'm asking for a big (or actually two big) new features, but if we keep looking at the future, I think it's in everyone's interest if these features get added to phpmyadmin. :)</detail>

        <title>Please display &quot;Show all&quot; button by default - ID: 3476721</title>
        <detail>It is currently painful to show all records in a table (as discussed in #3216130). One needs to look at the number of rows, enter that number in the field which asks the number of rows to show, then reset the starting row to 0 and press enter. 
 
There is actually a &quot;Show all&quot; button to do just that, the problem is that the button does not show by default. A configuration option needs to be enabled: 
$cfg['ShowAll'] boolean 
    Defines whether a user should be displayed a &quot;show all (rows)&quot; button in browse mode or not. 
http://www.phpmyadmin.net/documentation/ 
 
This option is disabled by default. 
 
The question is what disadvantages showing this button has. There is certainly a complexification of the interface, but this button is clearly worth it. It wouldn't take more actual space, as it uses the same line as other widgets (Page number). 
 
The only real disadvantage I can see is the performance cost of offering users to display all rows of a big table. This is not a security issue as users can already request all records by crafting a query as they want. But this button makes it easier for the user to involuntarily abuse resources. 
 
I believe this could be solved by warning the user his query may take a long time, for example with a JavaScript popup. Such a popup would have an efficiency cost - something should be done so that it can be gotten rid of (for example, &quot;Yes, and do not ask me again&quot;).</detail>

        <title>(ok 3.0) Hide InnoDB count warnings - ID: 1782477</title>
        <detail>Hi there, 
 
Could the ability be added to hide the display of the &quot;May be approximate. See FAQ 3.11&quot; warning that is displayed about the record count when using InnoDB tables? 
 
Although this is useful initially, there are circumstances where the experienced user will be aware of this limitation and will want to disable the display of the warning. 
 
The warning is displayed when browsing a table's contents and also when viewing the database's structure. 
 
As well as displaying the actual warning text, the option should also disable the lightbulb &quot;hint&quot; and the prepending of a tilde (~) to the record count of the tables. 
 
From what I can see, this would require the creation of an appropriate flag in the configuration files and then a few simple modifications to db_structure.php and libraries/display_tbl.lib.php to test for this flag before displaying the warning and adding the tilde / hint icon.</detail>

        <title>Metalink download support - ID: 1821622</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
Because there are no BitTorrent downloads yet, 
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1351277&amp;group_id=23067&amp;atid=377411, 
I would recommend to add Metalink downloads as they are supported by many clients now and there are very easy scripts to generate Metalinks 
 
It would be easier and faster to download new phpMyAdmin releases with .metalink files. 
 
See 
http://www.metalinker.org/ubuntu/ 
for an example of what is already possible. 
 
I attached a full example for the current phpMyAdmin 2.11.2 release, please try them in a download client of your choice (for example the current DownThemAll beta for Firefox). 
 
The Metalinks include MD5/SHA1/SHA256/ED2K checksums and piece hashes for faster error recognition and correction and all SourceForge mirrors including their country codes so one or even multiple nearer mirrors will be automatically selected for faster downloading. 
 
In addition, ED2K and Magnet links are included for cross-network P2P downloads and the attachment contains a XSL file to present a customizable and usable download page for clients without Metalink capability. 
 
 
Keep up the good work,

        <title>Add config option for old 2.2 table display format - ID: 678747</title>
        <detail>One of the features of PMA that I found the most user- 
friendly was how every option and feature at the table  
level was available in one screen.  This continued  
through the 2.2 branch, and then was changed such that  
each feature had its own &amp;quot;tab&amp;quot; starting in 2.3.0.  While I  
recognize that the change was made to better organize  
features, it also makes certain things less ergonomic.   
Consider: 
 
1) When I load up the details for a table, I often want to  
run a SQL query instantly.  Having to make one extra  
click to get to a SQL window doesn't seem like much  
effort, but when you do it hundreds of times (and have to  
wait for a system response each time), it gets annoying. 
 
2) Having the table's fields and field properties available  
to look at, while I'm composing a SQL query, was a big  
help if I didn't remember the datatypes or field names.   
Now they're on two separate screens and I have to either  
memorize it (a big task for larger dbs) or open two  
windows. 
 
Because of things like this, I've resisted loading up 2.3.x  
instances and still often run 2.2.6 in some places,  
despite the many other advantages of the new versions.   
As such, I request: 
 
- Please make a config option in config.inc.php to  
arrange table options in the old (pre-2.3) format.  Turn it  
off by default, of course, but please give me (and  
everyone else) the option.  I think you've already got  
most of the necessary code lying around from previous  
branches, so it shouldn't be a big deal. 
 
Thanks much,

        <title>Repair order in input/edit previous entries - ID: 3323195</title>
        <detail>A while back, the order of items shown when you put the cursor in a field so you can pick a previously used entry was in a logical order - alphanumeric, in fact. Then it started being displayed in a very bad order, totally mixed up, which seems to be based on how often you have used that particular entry. It makes it very difficult to (a) see if you've used it already or (b) find and select it. 
 
But I've found a fix, which I can't implement, but you can. http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sharepointinfopath/thread/4f739cec-220e-4ab2-a6d9-13079e43844a/

        <title>Views are shown with 0 columns in the left pane tooltip - ID: 1368213</title>
        <detail>When using views in a database, phpMyAdmin 2.6.3-pl1 
shows 0 columns in the tooltip (mouseover) for a view. 
 
Here's the code to add a workaround for that. Around 
line 482 directly after $tmp['Comment'] = 
($cfg['ShowTooltipAliasTB'] &amp;&amp; 
$cfg['ShowTooltipAliasTB'] !== 'nested' ? $tmp['Name'] 
: $tmp['Comment']); 
 
Add the following code: 
 
if ($tmp['Rows'] == NULL &amp;&amp; PMA_MYSQL_INT_VERSION &gt;= 
50000 &amp;&amp; strtolower($tmp['Comment']) == &quot;view&quot;) 
                { 
                        $result2 = 
PMA_DBI_try_query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 
'.PMA_backquote($db).&quot;.&quot;.PMA_backquote($tmp['Name'])); 
                        $tmp2 = 
PMA_DBI_fetch_assoc($result2); 
                        if (is_array($tmp2)) 
                        { 
                                $tmp['Rows'] = 
$tmp2[&quot;COUNT(*)&quot;]; 
                        } 
 
                } 
 
 
This workaround uses an additional query to execute a 
count(*) on a view. This might cause performance 
problems if the view is huge, but I haven't tested it 
with large datasets.</detail>

If one is at the the web page listing all the tables in that database, and then selects the SQL tab and then uses the pull down to pick a bookmarked SQL statement, and then selects the radio button to 'view only', the SQL statement is actually run upon submitting the form. However, if one is already viewing a particular table's properties when they select the SQL tab, and the dropdown with the SQL bookmark, then 'view only' *does* work properly.

        <title>Improved Primary/Foreign key integrity - ID: 837275</title>
        <detail>The PHP myadmin system seems to manage its own  
seperate set of 'relations'; these are not the enforced  
integrity constraints on the database but seem to be  
just a set of 'design notes' that allow browsing of data  
through non-enforced relationships. They bear no  
relationship to primary/foreign key relations in the actual  
databases. 
 
I suggest now that innodb table types support foreign  
key constraints, allowing the management of  
primary/foreign key relationships IN the database. There  
is no apparent visibility of foreign keys at all. This is an  
important aspect of relational databases in general and  
should be supported by such as great tool as pma!   :-) 
 
The current 'relations' system is confusing - it should be  
made clearer that these are just a set of pointers for  
pma users and do not exist in the database itself! 
 
just want to say (apart from the relations  
functionality  ;-)    ) what a great tool pma is, hat off to  
the project team!

tbl_relation.php3 though it does not have anything to

One example where the field comments are used is on the

field comments are set under &amp;quot;Relation view&amp;quot;. 
 
I suggest the part for editing field comments on 
tbl_relation.php3 is moved to a separate (own) page. 
And a link &amp;quot;Field comments&amp;quot; is added on 
tbl_properties_structure.php3.

I need to in some positive way log myself off the machine I was just on, and ideally have any access cookies deleted.  Calling the login.php?message=expired would probably be good enough. 
 
Anyway, it's a security issue for me.  If I finish a session, and someone at the library comes over and accesses the browser's history, they can just pop right back in where I left off.  Not a good thing.

        <detail>I don't like it when the edit and delete buttons  
disappear even if I only Round() one column... I've  
traced the &quot;problem&quot; down (to &quot;2.3 Other statements  
[...]&quot; in display_tbl.lib.php) and found out that the  
result set doesn't has the table attribute anymore in  
such cases. I'm using the 4.0 branch so it might be  
different in newer versions, but it might be a better  
idea anyways to figure out if the images should be  
displayed from the number of tables in the FROM clause  
or if there is a JOIN. That would be also more  
effective than cycling through all columns I suppose... 
 
For now I'll just hack in a quick and dirty fix so an  
empty table attribute will not cause the images to  
disappear. But well it's dirty because it will also  
display the images with a query from two or more  
tables, when some function is used on all columns of  
all (but one) tables.</detail>

only one thing: 
 
I use HTTP Authentication, it's great, the logout works

if I logout, the login window pops up again, this is 
good, however, it does not clear the screen behind the 
login window, of the last session, until you do 
something like press cancel on that login window. 
 
Someone could still read the last screen like this. 
 
I think it would be a good idea to clear the screen 
upon logout, THEN display the login window, floating on 
top of the cleared screen, rather than old data.

        <title>Text Size in phpMyAdmin - ID: 1459054</title>
        <detail>The base font size has become really large size since the 
last release (at least phpMyAdmin 2.8.0.2). I've 
pointed it out to Lem. His response is below. 
 
I think it would be a reasonable feature request to add 
something in the config.inc.php. Within the concept of 
open source, we could at least allow the base font and 
size to be configurable? If &quot;taille normal&quot; means 
normal size, at least let the config file decide which 
font. Arial normal size is quite big compared to Times 
New Roman normal size. 
 
Maybe ctrl+ or ctrl- is intuitive for some, but not All 
users. Some are not hardcore databasers; some are 
secretaries and researchers working for us, doing the 
grunt work. If they have to reduce the font size for 
one site and enlarge it for another, this makes for a 
*itchy office climate where change for change's sake 
does not bode well. 
 
&gt;Pour la taille des polices, maintenant phpMyAdmin 
&gt;utilise la taille normale de ton navigateur. 
&gt;Tout navigateur moderne peut modifier rapidement la 
&gt;taille de la police (avec firefox c'est control - ou +)

Column names like `order` without the backtick quotes 
are invalid. Please provide a proper warning when

especially with the whitespace problem! Whitespace may 
be copy/pasted from another application and should be 
trimmed in almost every case. 
Only in case of a plain stupid developer this might 
come in handy. Tables named ` ` (space) are not

        <title>(ok 3.4) AJAX-based graphical query builder - ID: 1572325</title>
        <detail>One admittedly quirky step in my workflow is to build complex MySQL  
queries using Microsoft Access' visual query builder.  This useful feature  
displays tables and their fields graphically, allowing me to construct  
queries quickly and intuitively by dragging and dropping query elements,  
including relationships.   
 
For the most part, the resulting SQL statements come over to MySQL  
easily, but it is an extra hurdle I wish I didn't have to jump through and is  
one which I don't jump unless I'm building complex queries with various  
types of JOIN statements.  I've been searching for an equivalent to Access'  
tool for ages but have never found one.  Some come close but none do  
exactly what I need with ease. 
 
If I had time, I would write my own AJAX tool to do this (I tend to roll my  
own solutions for this type of thing), but even the best tool I could write  
would be the poor man's replacement for one integrated directly into  
phpMyAdmin. 
 
(PS - To give you an idea of how useful this is to me: it is the *only* use  
for Access I've had in years, and is, in fact, one of the only uses I have for  
Windows at all.  I'm in a Mac environment, and every time I have to build a  
complex query, I have to fire up WinXP in a Parallels virtual machine.)</detail>

        <title>Generate SQL query to use later - ID: 3435596</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
Many times I want to add a new column, change another column, and add an index for the same table. 
But, once the table is already large, all these changes should be made at the same time (same query). 
 
It's hard to me to make the SQL query manually, so, phpMyAdmin would help me allot if I could just &quot;generate&quot; the SQL for each change BEFORE applying. Unfortunately, I must have a table for tests, so that I test there, and copy the generated query after it applied there, and then I accommodate it to the table I want. 
 
So, if phpMyAdmin had this feature, I could just &quot;simulate&quot; the queries, and then I join all of them manually into a single &quot;ALTER TABLE&quot; query (adding commas).</detail>

        <title>(ok 4.0)Table structure: disable popup menu under Action - ID: 3475567</title>
        <detail>When viewing the table structure of a complex table, often there is a delay in rendering the page because the drop-down menu under the &quot;Action&quot; column is being created. 
This is quite annoying. 
In previous versions all 7 action icons were displayed under the Action column. 
Now the following functions have been moved to a drop down menu: Browse unique values, add primary key, add unique key, add index, add fulltext index. 
This drop-down menu makes these functions slower to access and causes an uneccessary UI delay on older machines/browsers whilst the menus are built/rendered. 
 
I propose that you should be able to disable this action drop-down menu through configuration, and revert to the full iconified view of previous versions.

        <title>(in 2.6.1) Change Result-Page-Selector - ID: 925817</title>
        <detail>Sorry for my English ;) 
 
I have only one small suggest, you could change the  
page-selector on the &quot;result&quot; or &quot;view&quot; page. 
 
It's not funny to scroll and click and scroll and click...  
when you have a big result. 
Estimate you have a result with about 30000 rows. 
50 Items on each page, makes 600 Pages. 
But with your Drop-Down-Field you only display the first  
10. 
 
 
I created a selector which displays the first pages, then  
goes in big steps to the current selected page, but a  
few pages before and after it changes the step size. 
It maybe also ever displays the 33%, 50% 66% Pages 
 
This is the behavior the Selector uses. 
 
(We are on Page 50 from 100) 
Pages 
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 30, 45, 47, 48, 49, 
50, 
51, 52, 53, 55, 70, 85, 90, 94, 97, 100 
 
The Step-Size changes, this can be set in relation to  
the amount of the result. 
(Steps with the width of percents from the whole  
amount of data.)</detail>

        <title>Data-Export/Import direct into another mysql server - ID: 1639546</title>
        <detail>Sometimes I miss a feature in phpMyAdmin, that allows to Export a whole Database or a single Table direct into another MySQL Server. For example, I have a database &quot;test&quot; on Server A. Now I want to copy the complete database (structure and data) into server B.  
 
By now, you have to export the data as an SQL File (which can get very large), copy it to server B, and import it there. That comes with all problems, apache, php and MySQL provide :-). MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE, MAX_EXECUTION_TIME, mysql has gone away... 
 
I imagine an extra option in the EXPORT (or the Import) tab, called &quot;export to another server&quot; or similar. Then I provide IP/Host, user name, password and the database name, and finally, phpmyadmin starts transferring the data. 
 
I don't think, that this is very difficult to code, but I believe, that many users could find this feature helpful.

you have put standard default value for date:

when I try do export the data saved to other databases

default value. 
 
Could you implement default value configuration or  
change the default value for date???? I think other  
people will have the same problem some time. 
 
I am trying to change my programm to function with  
other dbms. my programm is using often 0000-00-00 ..  
value if there is a value.

From the aspect of WAI it would be a better solution. I

    * Defragment table		- InnoDB 
    * Analyze table		- MyISAM 
    * Repair table		- MyISAM

    * Flush the table (&quot;FLUSH&quot;)	- MyISAM, InnoDB, MEMORY. 
 
Each item contains help link to http://dev.mysql.com. 
On &quot;Check table&quot; help page (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/check-table.html) users posted a lot of comments showing that they love to: 
 
1. Run &quot;CHECK TABLE&quot; query for all tables in DB, 
2. Cron it. 
 
The 2nd is out of phpMyAdmin's competence, but not the 1st. 
Suggestion is to add block &quot;Tables maintenance&quot; to &quot;Operations&quot; tab when DB is selected. 
For each item inside block, count how many tables in DB have type that support it. 
If none - hide item, else show number of tables that will be affected by operation, in brackets.</detail>

organize the users by &amp;quot;Personal&amp;quot; then &amp;quot;Buisness&amp;quot;. 
 
That would be one of the coolest things. And maybe an  
option in the config to either have the data bases in  
seperate drop downs per catagory or have some sort of  
seperator in the drop down for the catagory (if  
seperator is selected then it selects the first user in the

        <detail>Hello everyone, 
 
I thought that it would be nice if you could have a  
file/folder that has the name somewhat like &quot;setup&quot;  
where you are brought into several steps where you can  
enter your SQL information, to install it. 
 
I know that novices will not like looking at a PHP code  
and not knowing they're doing to try to setup  
phpMyAdmin. 
 
After installation, maybe you should impliment it where  
the directory/file has to be deleted before you can use  
phpMyAdmin ? 
 
Just an idea, but you don't have to use it if you don't  
want to.

means I cannot upload and execute a local sql file

Is it possible to specify the sql file location as a

to the host and run as normal.

        <title>Comment the first output line when dumping a database - ID: 899588</title>
        <detail>When you export (dump) a database, if you &quot;select all&quot; 
&amp; &quot;copy&quot; the whole output, when you &quot;paste&quot; it in the 
SQL query window you get an error message because of 
the title present in the exported database. If you 
could add a comment sign in front of the title, it 
would be possible to select all, copy, and paste such 
text directly as a SQL query without problems. 
 
 
Example: 
 
- Current: 
 
 Database example  running on localhost 
 
# phpMyAdmin SQL Dump 
# version 2.5.5-pl1 
# http://www.phpmyadmin.net 
#

        <detail>I have produced a somewhat relational database using  
mysql.  It would be great if I could dynamically populate  
enum fields with data from other related tables, as the  
data in the &amp;quot;lookup&amp;quot; tables is augmented from time to  
time.  As of now, the enum and set datatypes do seem  
to be able to take static lists of variables, but they  
cannot be dynamically populated.

        <title>Behaviour of Browse Button - ID: 1294369</title>
        <detail>Sometimes I &quot;Empty&quot; a Table using phpMyadmin and in the 
next moment I let some other program insert some date 
into this table. 
 
To view the new entered row I have to click on the tiny 
tiny &quot;Browse&quot; icon before the table name in the 
tablelist (on the leftlost side of the screen) because 
my favourite and huge &quot;Browse&quot; button on the top of the 
page is disabled (caused by my click on the 
&quot;Empty&quot;-button). 
 
I think it would be better, when the big &quot;Browse&quot; 
button would behave exactly like the one in the table 
list or maybe show a notice that the table is still empty. 
 
 
Thanks for this great piece of software and excuse my 
English.

        <title>Import local sql dump - ID: 1240011</title>
        <detail>Currently the only method of importing a database dump 
is by selecting the file on the clients computer for 
upload, or manual query in the box provided. The 
biggest disadvantage with this is, if you have a large 
file, let's say 20MB, it's incredibly difficult to 
import that file into MySQL. The only option I can 
think of, if you're bright, is importing it using ssh 
on a linux server, which many people may not know how 
to do this. 
 
What I would like to see is a thrid option. An option 
where the client can upload the sql dump via ftp and 
choose a server path to the file in phpmyadmin and 
import it, regardless of size. This would eliminate the 
need to upload the file, as it would already be present 
on the server. And ofcource, depending on size, the 
file could be broken up by phpmyadmin and executed in 
cycles. This would be VERY useful.</detail>

        <detail>I am: Viatcheslav V. Vassiliev 
e-mail: support@www-sharp.com 
 
www-Sharp.Runtime (http://www-sharp.com/runtime/)  
is in-process web-server (asynchronous protocol  
handler) that works with IE5.5+. With www- 
Sharp.Runtime it is possible to access phpMyAdmin  
without standalone web-server with URL  
like &amp;quot;php://phpMyAdmin/&amp;quot;. 
 
Custom protocol (in example, &amp;quot;php://&amp;quot;) could not be  
currently detected automatically. To do this, change in  
libraries/common.lib.php should be done: 
 
lines  
 
$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri']= ((!empty($HTTPS) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;  
strtolower($HTTPS) != 'off') ? 'https' : 'http') . '://' 
 . $HTTP_HOST; 
 
should be changed to: 
 
 
if (isset(${$SERVER_ARRAY}['HTTP_SCHEME'])) { 
 $HTTP_SCHEME = ${$SERVER_ARRAY} 
['HTTP_SCHEME'];

It can be very simplistic, like in Enterprise Manager for

        <title>Change the appearance of the PDF_SCHEMA - ID: 2107836</title>
        <detail>Right now, I'm working on a 40 tables InnoDB database with many FK going around. I wanted to print the relations using the pdf tool, but I'm having a problem. As I see it, when you send it to print, the only option you have is for the tables to be &quot;big&quot; which means that all fields are listed. For me that is the worst case I could get, since I can't find a way to arrange all on screen and still be legible.  
 
Ideally I would like to have the option to only show the fields which HAS a FK with another table, if that is not an option, to show the tables as &quot;small&quot; (i.e. only the table name and the relationship lines).  
 
This would give us a much cleaner export, especialy when we are talking about 20+ big tables.</detail>

        <title>Allow exporting to be based off of a sql statement - ID: 991743</title>
        <detail>It would be nice to allow a SQL statement in the export 
area.  An example for this would be that I only want to 
backup a certain part of the database based off of some 
SQL statement.  I then manipulate the fields that need 
manipulated.  Something went wrong, I delete the fields 
based off of the same SQL statement and then want to 
load the backup i did from the SQL statement. 
 
My reasoning is that i'm working with a database that 
is 1.6GB and there are 2 tables that are over 500MB.  
It would be nice to backup just parts of these tables 
instead of backing up the whole table and then 
importing the whole table again.

        <title>PDF schema sort options - ID: 778346</title>
        <detail>I'd like to see an assignable sort order for the table list. I see  
three useful possibilities: 
 
  1. Sort on table name (I've patched mine to do this) 
  2. Sort on table organization 
     e.g. ORDER BY x, y -or- ORDER BY y,x 
  3. Sort by database order (current) 
 
It requires adding a simple ORDER BY statement at the end of the  
$page_query assignment in pdf_pages.php. All I've done to mine  
is add  
  . ' ORDER BY table_name' 
at the end of the $page_query assignment. This may not be the  
correct way (I'm not very familiar with the PMA infrastructure)  
but it works. 
 
This could be selectable on the page (retained between  
submissions) and settable as a default. 
 
 
Also, I'd like to see the 'Display PDF Button' state maintained  
between submissions for changes to the layout, possibly even  
between sessions (or at least a default that can be changed).  
For instance, I typically shut off 'Data Dictionary' when I'm  
working on the layout. 
 
 
Thanks for the great product,

        <title>Change session timeouts before &quot;slow&quot; operations - ID: 1633845</title>
        <detail>If the MySQL server has timeouts set, such as the following, in my.cnf, phpMyAdmin may discover that the MySQL server has gone away when performing a &quot;slow&quot; operation such as Operations --&gt; Sort on a large table. 
 
  interactive_timeout=60 
 
Example SQL issued by phpMyAdmin: 
 
  ALTER TABLE `rik1` ORDER BY `alok` 
 
...where `rik1` is a large table which takes a long time to sort (alter). 
 
The error message (apparently phpMyAdmin issues this after? the sorting, the important thing is the error code at the end): 
 
---8&lt;--- 
Fel 
 
SQL-frga: Dokumentationndra 
 
SELECT master_field, foreign_db, foreign_table, foreign_field 
FROM `pmadb`.`pma_relation` 
WHERE master_db = 'ortnamndb' 
AND master_table = 'rik1' 
 
MySQL sa: Dokumentation 
#2006 -  
---&gt;8--- 
 
My suggestion would be that a timeout changing SQL command should precede all database connections to circumvent timeout problems on servers which have timeouts set: 
 
SET SESSION interactive_timeout=1800, SESSION wait_timeout=1800; 
 
...where 1800 (seconds) should be replaced by a large enough value, perhaps configurable? 
 
Thanks in advance!

        <title>config.inc.php missing - ID: 1459061</title>
        <detail>I've already discussed this with Lem. I noted in my 
last download of phpMyAdmin 2.8.0.2 that the 
config.inc.php was missing. 
 
I had to muck around Documentation.html ten minutes to 
figure out that I could re-use my old config.inc.php 
from my last install, (which was phpMyAdmin-2.6.4-pl3 
in fact). 
 
It took me another 5 minutes to figure out that I could 
reuse 
phpMyAdmin-2.8.0.2/libraries/config.default.php 
by saving a new copy in phpMyAdmin-2.8.0.2/. 
 
Ok, I'm whining. But what happens for the new user who 
goes looking for the config file? It isn't there. 
 
When I upgrade, myself, I prefer to use a brand new 
copy of config.inc.php, just in case ya'll decided to 
add something new. And ya'll did! I was actually 
waiting for this release to configure something new, so 
I indeed needed a new config.inc.php. It would have 
been shameful and useless to reuse the previous file 
from phpMyAdmin-2.6.4-pl3 - (shameful that I waited to 
upgrade too I suppose). 
 
Why not just put a copy of config.inc.php back in the 
root directory? 
 
Pretty please :)</detail>

UPDATE query, often I have to run such a query on 
important data (which I naturally backup first), but it 
would spare a lot of time when the query could be

An easy fix would be when I have a query like: 
UPDATE `important_table` SET 
`more_important_row`='newvalue' WHERE 
`more_important_row`='oldvalue' 
 
The simulation would be something like: 
SELECT *, 'newvalue' as `more_important_row` FROM 
`important_table` WHERE `more_important_row`='oldvalue' 
 
As you can see the simulation is only to check the 
WHERE part of the query, but may be there are other 
uses for it?</detail>

Today i realised i needed a function to copy entire structure of selected fields from one table to another. 
 
If i should make some kind of backup table but with additional fields. I could just create the new table with the additional fields and then copy selected fields from the main table to the backup table. 
 
Or if you are using some generic fields as; status, creation timestamp etc etc. it would be great to copy them from one table to another. 
And also a functionality to select what field the fields should be inserted after.</detail>

        <title>Favourites - ID: 1437308</title>
        <detail>Hello, 
 
As webdeveloper I often use phpMyAdmin as a database 
administration tool and in most of the cases I use it 
to check record insertion by making queries over and over. 
 
What happens here is that every time I log in I need to 
go through all those steps to make my queries again, 
sometimes I keep them in text files so i don't need to 
write them again. 
 
My idea is to create, maybe a top tab along with those 
&quot;export&quot;, &quot;empty&quot;, &quot;drop&quot; ... width the name of 
&quot;favourites&quot; where we could keep our favourite queries 
so we don't have do keep writing them over and over. 
 
A way to add a query to &quot;favourites&quot; would be adding a 
link, after a query has been made, next to the 
&quot;refresh&quot; link. 
 
Thanks in advance and keep it cool,

        <title>(ok 3.4) New config variable to hold session_save_path - ID: 1379201</title>
        <detail>I found it necessary to hardcode the  
session_start_path just before session_start() in  
libraries/session.inc.php e.g. session_save_path  
('/nfs/cust/8/73/26/462378/web/tmp/'); 
 
This is because my host uses multiple servers such  
that session cookies get 'lost' unless this path is  
declared in one's own space.  
 
The problem occurs even if config is used for  
authentication rather than cookies. 
 
It would be preferable to have this stored in a  
config variable . 
 
Marc Delisle found the solution for me (thanks Marc).</detail>

        <title>Checkbox styling - ID: 1563544</title>
        <detail>As Internet Explorer does not support stylesheets with  
[attr] selector, I would appretiate if you add a class  
attribute to the input type=checkbox. 
The default margin/padding values of checkboxes are in  
many cases too big, so the rows in the table are  
stretched in height where the normal content is  
smaller. 
 
I've added the attribute myself but I don't want to do  
it avery time a new version comes out.

        <title>(ok 3.2) Add troubleshooting page for linked tables features - ID: 1731967</title>
        <detail>I've installed phpMyAdmin on many systems, but I'm always running into problems with the linked tables infrastructure. I waste lots of time going round and round, reading the docs, tweaking configs, creating users, assigning permissions, but it seems to be entirely random whether the linked tables features work, even though everything seems to be as it should. 
 
What would be really helpful is a diagnostics page where the linked tables features could be completely tested and faults diagnosed.</detail>

it would be nice to have the possibility to select a automatic Refresh of the Process list.

        <title>Export to AXMLS ADOdb format - ID: 985472</title>
        <detail>It would be very useful feature to export MySQL tables  
into cross-database format, such as AXMLS to create  
table schemas for other DB types. 
 
Since phpMyAdmin is able to export to XML already there  
should not be any problems to transform output XML into  
AXMLS.

        <title>Allow designer to show other Databases - ID: 2235760</title>
        <detail>One feature I would like to see is the ability to see on the designer, and on the Relations View, even if it is based on a global setting, all the valid index on other databases not the current one only. On my current project, we have a central InnoDB DB called basic_info, and each module implements a new DB and have tons of foreign keys references to this basic info. Right now I have to right the SQL everytime I want to add a new FK to this other DB, since it doesn't show on the dropdown menu on the &quot;Relation View&quot;. Nor I can put these tables on the designer. 
 
Is it possible? And if so, lem9, I'm willing to try to tackle this problem and do a patch for it. Just need some pointers, specially on the designer part.</detail>
