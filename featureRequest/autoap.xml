        <title>Add new Micro Build v24 Pre-SP2 w/GUI &amp; AutoAP - ID: 2914540</title>
        <detail>Request new build based on the micro DD-WRT VINT firmware image, including AutoAP and GUI the previous work of art to replace the GREAT, but unfortunately much out of date &quot;dd-wrt.v24_micro_generic.aapng.20070822RC1b.zip&quot;. 
 
This replacement updated build, based on VINT firmware, would work with most DD-WRT compatible hardware out there, and would not only improve on discovered security concerns, but also greatly simplify AutoAP deployment and configuration in a variety of routers.  While dreaming...if it were possible to add a tab for the AutoAP GUI into the default DD-WRT GUI, and a tab in the AutoAP to go back to the DD-WRT (make it look 'integrated'?), it would be beautiful!</detail>

        <title>Connect to preferred WPA access point - ID: 3307647</title>
        <detail>Any plans to make AutoAP able to connect to WPA access points?  It connects very nicely to WEP-protected systems, but not to WPA.</detail>
