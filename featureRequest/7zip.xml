CRC32 gets more and more replaced by other checksums, 
it would be nice to have 7z store other checksums, than 
CRC32.</detail>

        <title>#928 Console output redirection</title>
        <detail> I have about 470 3.5&quot; and 5.25&quot; floppy discs to archive onto CD and there are numerous .zip files amongst them. I have worked out how to recursively apply 7z to .zip's at all folder levels (done via 'for /R etc' so I could manipulate output folder names - more in another feature request). It would be useful if 7z could redirect its console output to a file for perusal later (eg. to manually use another archiving program to unzip files that 7z wouldn't or note which archives couldn't be opened). I can get around this by putting the 7z command line in a batch file and calling that with redirected output but it's not as elegant. Also, if console output redirection were implemented, the feature could be expanded to group error types within the output file or output to separate files according to error type. For now, though, I'll have a quick look to see if token parsing using DOS enhancements wil do the trick.</detail>

        <title>#92 Optimize zip files</title>
        <detail> Since different zip programs tend to use slightly  
different compression methods, I find that I can get  
better compression ratios by using various different  
zip programs (although 7-zip usually provides the  
best one:) ), but when I want to get a zip file as small  
as I possibly can, I tend to have to zip the files into  
different archives using different zip programs,  
compare the compressed sizes, then manually add  
the files into a new archive with whichever program  
zipped them best.  Would it be possible for 7-zip to  
compare the files automatically, then to create a new  
archive with all the best compression ratios?  That  
would make 7-zip able to always equal or (usually)  
outdo other zip programs.</detail>

        <title>#875 Option for delete source (dir tree) after compressing</title>
        <detail> Assume I want to add a whole directory tree to a 7zip archive.  
This can be done through the WinExplorer context menu.  What is missed at this moment is an option &quot;Wipe src after adding&quot; in the &quot;Add to Archive&quot; dialog window  
which let me AUTOMATICALLY delete the whole source dir tree (or file  
for single files). after SUCCESSFUL adding/creating of the archive. A similar option should be offered for the opposite way: 
The initial 7zip archive should AUTOMATICALLY be deleted after SUCCESSFUL  
extraction.  These options should be easy to implement and be added in the next release</detail>

Size = 171776 
Packed Size =  
Modified = 2006-08-15 11:21:00 
Attributes = ....A 
CRC = 2F2C2ED0 
Method = BCJ2 LZMA:26 LZMA:20 LZMA:20 
Block = 1 The suggestion is to put this in table format, that is similar to how the 7-Zip GUI shows the information when in View Details mode.  It could be tab delimited. Table (matching the 7-Zip GUI): 
Name/Path, Size, Packed Size, Modified, Attributes, Method, Block, CRC Use case: 
Further processing or viewing of the output files would be made easier.  At present it is a difficult for a intermediate level user to convert the output format into a table that can be manipulated in a spreadsheet, unless he/she writes a script to do the conversion.</detail>

        <title>#1017 split-join as part of 7-zip cmdline for small filesystems</title>
        <detail> splitting and joining of volumes should be part of 7-zip commandline parameters.  it should be part of 7-zip as a whole.  what I mean is, it should be able to archive while splitting into bite-size chunks of n size.  n should be a 64-bit number. 
 the purpose of this feature is to make provisions for filesystems such as FAT32 and FAT16, which people still use, and must put archive files on, but the filesystem cannot handle more than 4GiB per file.  or floppies which can only handle 1440KB, or DVD's which can only handle 4700MB. or cd's which can only handle 737MB, and then there's blu-ray, DL-DVDR... the problem comes when you have an 18+GB archive. 
 you are now in the position that you can't join them in order to unzip them.  ouch.  what you need is the kind of 7-zip which can unzip a volume in pieces without joining.  sequentially numbered chunks.  and don't think 2 digits are going to suffice. 
this is probably going to require a partial rewrite of the compression and decompression engine.  but it will make 7-zip FAR more useful, maybe even as a backup tool on unix systems and windows systems! (look - new feature/bullet point for the web page) 
this is nothing like the existing split tool in 7-zip GUI - it has no smarts. I have written an very enhanced atoi64 which could be of use for this which handles hexadecimal, octal, binary, and decimal (different number types), and also handles computer-size measurements and SI measurements as suffixes _B, _KB, _MB, _GB, _TB, _PB, _EB, _KiB, _MiB, _GiB, _TiB, _PiB, _EiB. 
it works quite well except that it returns 0 on error, like atoi64.  I am attaching it.  I hope you will find it useful enough to use throughout 7-zip for inputting numbers.</detail>

        <title>#232 Select All for Association Dialogue Box</title>
        <detail> Under the 7-Zip File Manager's Tools&gt;Options...&gt;System  
tab where you associate file extensions with 7-Zip,  
there should be a &quot;Select All&quot; button to automatically  
check all file types.  I install the program on friends' and  
family's systems and each time I do it I have to go  
through and check off all 12 file associations.  As the  
program gets bigger and supports more file types, this  
will only get more annoying.  A Select All button would  
be a big help and definitely remove an annoyance for  
people who have to set up the program.</detail>

        <detail> I made a multivolume archive on CDs (700MB) and I  
tried to unzip from the CDs. 7-ZIP is not asking for the next volume in series but  
is making a copy of the file and is changing the  
extension of the file from &quot;.7z.001&quot; in &quot;.7z&quot; It will be useful to ask for the next volume(s) so you  
can inset the next CD/DVD.</detail>

        <title>#984 store sha1 alongside crc for each file</title>
        <detail> Option -slt shows crc for file. That's great an allows user too look for this value in other databases. So without decompression I can guess &quot;what&quot; data is inside. 
Problem is that crc isn't efficient from security point of view. 
Is there any way to add support for other hash storage? MD5 is getting weak, so maybe sha1 or just go for best one and choose sha512? That's only 64 bytes per file. Regards,

        <title>#949 Multiple Individual files archiving/ encrypting</title>
        <detail> Sir, I am using your program for about 1 year now and have found it very usefull. However, the following additions are highly required: 1. Option &quot;Make individual archives&quot; in the dialog &quot;Add to archive...&quot; when multiple selected files/folders are right clicked. 2. Option &quot;Extract indivial archives&quot; on right clicking one 7z file, few 7z files (after selection) or a folder that contains 7z files. 3. Instead of replacing file name extension with 7z (filename.ext is changed to filename.7z), there should be option for retaining original file name extension as filename.ext.7z. This shall help to know which kind of file exist in the archive without opening it. I have attached my experience files. These may provide some tips for 7-Zip improvement. I have a program (a tutorial program) (single exe file of 10mb size) that can be run as an administrator only, in the Windows Vista OS. Actually, it is some kind of compressed archive (7z shows all individual files in the program as encrypted). I double clicked the program, and opened task manager (taskmgr.exe) and tried to create memory dump file. The task manager refused to create memory dump file. This is a great technique. Probably this shall protect (safe guard) passwords from memory dump attack for 7-Zip program. Kindly, if possible apply this technique in 7-Zip program. I shall send you the program if required by you for analysis. Yours faithfully, Sunny Saini

        <detail> I would like to request the following enhancments in the command-line tool z7.exe:  add a &quot;m&quot; command: &quot;m&quot;ove files to the archive. the functionality would be to add/update files found on disk to the referenced archive and, once committed to disk, remove (delete) the files from disk.  add a &quot;-fdb&quot; / &quot;-fda&quot; switch: &quot;f&quot;ilter &quot;d&quot;ate &quot;b&quot;efore/&quot;a&quot;fter. the format for the parameter would be -fdb[yyyymmddhhss]. so, when adding/updating/moving to an archive, it would only select the files that have a modification date before or after the given date/time. it may be that you want to add a general &quot;f&quot;ilter switch and do it for more than just date... attributes could be another useful addition to this one.  I believe these would be extremely useful. I can help do this.... </detail>

        <title>#847 queue compressions</title>
        <detail> Hi. First of all I'd like to thank the author, helpers and mantainers of this excellent and amazing piece of software. ;) 
I'd like to suggest an option to make queues available. If I tell the 7-Zip I want to compress a file, and after that I want to compress another file/directory the 7-Zip is going to open a second windows to do the job in the same time. It would be awesome if 7-Zip had the option to queue this action and make 7-Zip only execute this after the first compression is over. It would be really great for us, one threaded CPU, users.</detail>

        <title>#445 generate archive name using the current date and time</title>
        <detail> Switch -AG[format] - generate archive name using the 
current date and time like WinRAR archiver. Appends the current date string to an archive name 
when creating an archive. Useful for daily backups. 
Format of the appending string is defined by the 
optional format parameter or by &quot;YYYYMMDDHHMMSS&quot; if 
this parameter is absent. The format string may include 
the following characters: Y   year 
M   month 
MMM month as text string (Jan, Feb, etc.) 
W   a week number (a week starts with Monday) 
A   day of week (Monday is 1, Sunday is 7) 
D   day of month 
E   day of year 
H   hours 
M   minutes (treated as minutes if encountered after hours) 
S   seconds 
N   archive number. WinRAR searches for already existing 
archive with generated name and if found, increments 
the archive number until generating a unique name. 
Each of format string characters listed above 
represents only one character added to archive name. 
For example, use WW for two digit week number or YYYY 
to define the four digit year. 
If the first character in the format string is '+', 
positions of the date string and base archive name are 
exchanged, so a date will precede an archive name. 
The format string may contain optional text enclosed 
in '{' and '}' characters. This text is inserted into 
archive name. 
All other characters are added to an archive name 
without changes. If you need to update an already existing archive, 
be careful with -ag switch. Depending on the format 
string and time passed since previous -ag use, 
generated and existing archive names may mismatch. In 
this case WinRAR will create a new archive instead of 
updating the already existing. Examples: 1) use the default YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format winrar a -ag backup 2) use DD-MMM-YY format winrar a -agDD-MMM-YY backup 3) use YYYYMMDDHHMM format, place date before 'backup'  winrar a -ag+YYYYMMDDHHMM backup 4) use YYYY-WW-A format, include fields description winrar a -agYYYY{year}-WW{week}-A{wday} backup 5) use YYYYMMDD and the archive number. It allows to 
generate unique names even when YYYYMMDD format mask 
used more than once in the same day winrar a -agYYYYMMDD-NN backup</detail>

 Ideally, the command-line progress should flush each line when adding/extracting so that another process can monitor the output file.</detail>

Unfortunately, If the receiver hasn't 7z installed, it has to deal with the command prompt (with the COPY/B command), in order to rejoin the archive, or I have to write and send him a BAT file, for this job. I wish 7z to has an option for creating a standard ZIP file as the header file (the very first), or at least, to autocreate a BAT, for rejoining the splited archive. THANKS!!! :-)</detail>

I've been waiting a very long time for 7-Zip to integrate a &quot;Smart Extract&quot; feature where 7-Zip automatically determines whether to extract here or extract to a folder. When there's only one file or one folder, 7-Zip should simply extract that file or folder here. When there are two or more items in the archive root, it should extract them into a new folder named after the archive. I shouldn't need to make the decision for 7-Zip - it should make that simple decision on its own!</detail>

        <detail> I've looked through the Help file, and the Gui, and there's one feature I would really like to see included that isn't presently available. When I set 7z to extract or compress while running in the background (low prority?), I would like an audible sound to execute to notify me that the task has been completed before it simply disappears from the taskbar or system tray. In the GUI/Context Menu, if there was an option that could be checked or unchecked to play a sound file upon completion, it could allow users to choose to enable or disable sound when running 7z only in the background. An option to allow a user to choose any .wav file, like those found in the Media folder in the Windows Operating Systems, would allow users to not only choose the sound they prefer, but also eliminates any need to include a wave audio file with 7z builds. Again, this is only for when 7z is running in the &quot;background&quot;.</detail>

        <detail> Many file types, not only ZIP itself but also MS Office 2007/2010 (xslx,docx etc), Java JAR, Mozilla XPI and many other, are de facto ZIP archives. When 7-Zip packs a set containing such files, it cannot gain considerable compressing ratio because of ZIP archives are pseudorandom binary files. If 7-Zip will repack content of such files on-the-fly using LZMA algorithm, it may gain significally better compression ratio. Of course, when 7-Zip will unpack an archive containing repacked ZIP file, it shall repack a LZMA-packed content in a ZIP file on-the-fly. This proposition may also be helpful for CAB, MSI and other common packed file formats.</detail>

        <title>#1027 Multi-volume Multi-part ZIP support</title>
        <detail> Is it possible to implement support for multi-volume (or multi-part) ZIP archive (the PKZIP- WINZIP ones) without merging them in an single file first? 
I have seen that even the last release of Info-zip can create such archive and so I think it could be a sort of full compatibility with the ZIP format. Also the &quot;compress folder&quot; utility in windows can manage multi-part ZIP archive created with Info-ZIP. For a full compatibility with the ZIP format it could be useful the extract option only (no the creation if you don't like such type of format). Best Regards 
Filippo B.</detail>

        <detail> Hi, First thanks for this great software. I wanted to submit a feature request: maybe 7zip could 
ask the user if he to extract all the files in the 
archive when double-clicking on a file named setup.exe 
or install.exe. Or even any file named *.exe I could be easy but great (I think winzip and winrar 
already do it) Thanks!!</detail>

        <detail> WinZip 10 added support for PPMD algorithm. They did it 
by extending zip file format with new method. As 7zip already supports the file format and the 
algorithm, it should not be very difficult to support 
this winzip-extended zip file. More details:

Windows 7 adds a great new feature to the Taskbar: the ability for applications to show a progress bar as in their icon.

        <title>#922 CTRL+F searching for files needed in GUI - and easy to use</title>
        <detail> When using 7zip user can't find needed files due to lack of any &quot;search&quot; or &quot;find&quot; button nor CTRL+F. This is really needed in everyday using of such a program. I have searched forum, wikipedia, program help, and haven't found any way how to find/search needed file in archive!! From forum posts I have learned that such demands are repeating from 2003 year and still problem is unsolved. Please add such an option to GUI as users just need it, without it it is useless for very many everyday purposes.  There is no visible for me neither &quot;find&quot; or &quot;search&quot; nor CTRL+F does not show any searching possibilities. I'd like to switch to 7Z but lack of this basic ability in such a program does not allow me to resign from winRaR. How this can be that I can't find how to search needed files in archives? Well, I can't find how to find..... ;-) I have this problem from long long time.  I also tried to find any plug in doing this, but I haven't found it mentioned anywhere: nither at site, nor in wikipedia, nor in help in software, nor at forum posts. Or I was looking for completely wrong words, but I suppose 99% of common users would search (have searched) in the same way, but would find (have found nothing sloving problem. If there is a solution is hidden against user completely - what would be senseless IMHO.  I am aware that this can be problem of developer time, I apprecaite 7zip developer efforts and effects very much really thank you. But lack of searching function is really very painful. I think some code could be borrowed/imported from other open source software eg. Shareaza (SourceForge) has implemented searching, with regular expresions even (as I know in my limited knowleadge). I think Shareaza from 2001 has worked through every possibly variant/option/possibility of searching by filname - searching for files in directories and others places is one of most fundamental option. Perhaps this code or part of this code could be used or modified to be useable here. At last ctrl+f please...??? That also would be good if typing woulod ccause searchin whittin currrent directory like FireFox does???  Please consider this, searching possibility, as equally important for common users as eg. LZMA for &amp;zip developer. </detail>

        <title>#921 Use clipboard to copy/paste files</title>
        <detail> In most file managers I can copy and paste files from one folder to another. The operation is very similar to drag and drop. Instead of selecting and dragging, I select and hit copy. Then, I navigate to the folder the files I just copied need to go. I then hit paste. I find this feature extremely useful. 7-Zip File Manager does support drag and drop. I can drag files between two 7-Zip File Manager windows or between 7-Zip File Manager and windows explorer, and vice versa. This is great. To my dismay, however, I cannot copy and paste. Is it possible to add this feature? (and just make it behave like drag and drop)</detail>

Could you please make support easier by: * Making 7z.dll load icons of a Icon folder if available, like that icon packs would not have to mess with 7z.dll. * Alternatively you could also just create a icon.dll that's just a stub with the icon res (maintaining a copy in 7z.dll) and loading resources of the icon.dll if available. This would allow icon pack authors to distribute their icons without having to update every single update (like from 4.63-&gt;4.64) and avoiding problems with mismatching dll versions.</detail>

I can currently do this using  for /R %F in (*.Zip) do &quot;c:\Program Files\File Utilities\7-zip\7z&quot; e &quot;%F&quot;  -o&quot;%~npF&quot; where the DOS enhancements allow me to extract the necessary information, for the iteration's output, from the %F parameter. But it was hard work getting this far as I needed to use DOS recursion, instead of 7-Zip's recursion, to extract the output file name.

        <title>#703 Change Compression Level &amp; Method in 7 Zip File Manager</title>
        <detail> Recently we decided to copy all of our 7-zip archives to DVD's. When creating a 7-zip archive, we usually used the faster compression levels in the past. 
 Our archives will usually fit on a blank DVD but sometimes the archive is a just a little bit larger than the DVD. We don't want the split the archives since they are just a little over the size of a blank DVD. We would like a feature to select a file or folder in the archive using the 7-zip file manager, right mouse click, and change the compression level and/or method.  This would allow a user to change the size of an archive without deleting a folder or two and then adding them back to the desired archive.  This should also preserve file and folder timestamps.  Extracting and re-archiving will maintain file timestamps but folder timestamps are lost. Wishful for your consideration of our request in future releases. Anyhow, Great Product! </detail>

of files and then 7zipping the .tar file. I propose you 
add a feature to do this for you in one step rather 
than manually tarring something and then 7zipping it.</detail>

propose the &quot;add to XXX&quot; for any of the archive formats

        <title>#244 converting .7z files to self-extracting .exe files</title>
        <detail> With 3.13 to build an auto-extracting (.exe) 7z archive, I  
must decide and do it when building the archive, because  
there is no way to make a self-extracting file from a 7z  
file without decompressing and recompressing (which can  
be a big time loss on big archives). It would be more convenient if some operation was  
available to make the conversion directly, without  
decompressing and recompressing. Typical usage: I want to keep my archives in .7z format  
on my disks, and occasionnaly I want to send one of  
those archives to a friend that didn't install 7-zip (for any  
reason, shame on him :). So I convert the file to .exe  
and attach it to a mail. Today I have to do it in 2 steps  
(one quite short and the other a lot longer).</detail>

context menu so that in Windows explorer.exe the user 
can use the right mouse button to open / extract /

This e. g. gets used by the original windows 2000 and 
XP implementation of .zip --&gt; opening zip behaves like 
the zip beeing a subfolder if the folder it is 
contained in. It would be great if 7z would support that, too: If a 
.7z file is double clicked, it should not open a dialog 
windows showing the content, but it should embed into 
the explorer to visualize the content as beeing a 
subfilder by just putting the 7z view into the &quot;right&quot; 
panel of the explorer.</detail>

        <title>#308 7-Zip File Manager: Folder View</title>
        <detail> Great piece of software, fellows. Keep up the good work! I noticed that the 7-Zip File Manager displays the 
contents of archives only in &quot;Folder View&quot;, i.e. only 
one folder at a time. (Unless I simply didn't find the 
corresponding option despite my thorough research.) Other compression softwares allow to view the WHOLE 
content of the archive, independent of the folder the 
files are stocked in. 
- Left hand panel: all folders in the archive (hierarchy) 
- Right hand panel: all files in archive (with a new 
column: 'path') This global view allows to find files faster and to 
detect duplicates at once. I find it very useful in 
other compression softwares and think it would be an 
important enhancement to 7-Zip.</detail>

        <detail> When trying to unpack Multi-Volume 7z or Rar Archives that have one (or more) corrupt or missing volumes, 7-Zip (4.65 and 9.10beta) is not able to show the name / number of the corrupt volume. This often happens when downloading Multi-volumes over the internet. So it is impossible to know which volumes to retransmit. Btw Winrar is doing just fine and tells which volume is the first corrupt one. 7zip just tells the files it has not been able to extract FROM the archive. It would be much better if you could make 7zip report also the corrupt volume number.

GZip in the archive format drop-down list when applied

list should not offer Tar when applied to a single file. This is especially useful when you first create a 
&amp;quot;file.tar&amp;quot; from a group of files in a &amp;quot;file&amp;quot; directory 
and then want to create a &amp;quot;file.tar.gz&amp;quot; from that 
single file.tar. But, 7zip would allow to apply Tar 
format on the already tar'ed file which would be, of 
course, useless. rob.</detail>

        <detail> An option to store, rather than try to compress certain 
already compressed files will save a lot of time (when 
these exist). (I believe an example of this is the -ms switch in Winrar.) A default list might include: 
7z zip cab bz2 jpg mp3 ... 
----- 
In fact, here is Winrar's note on the subject: -ms[list] 
Specify file types to store. Specify file types, which will be stored 
without compression. 
This switch may be used to store already 
compressed files, 
which helps to increase archiving speed 
without noticeable 
loss in the compression ratio. Optional  parameter defines the list 
of file extensions 
separated by semicolons. For example, 
-msrar;zip;jpg will 
force RAR to store without compression all 
RAR and ZIP 
archives and JPG images. It is also allowed 
to specify wildcard 
file masks in the list, so 
-ms*.rar;*.zip;*.jpg will work too. If  is not specified, -ms switch will 
use the default 
set of extensions, which includes the 
following file types: ace, arj, bz2, cab, gz, jpeg, jpg, lha, 
lzh, mp3, 
rar, zip, taz, tgz, z -----

        <title>#981 Avoid file/disk fragmentation during decompression</title>
        <detail> ISSUE:  
Especially large files decompressed by 7-ZIP are created from the start with significant file fragmentation on the disk. CAUSE: 
7-ZIP seems to write-out decompressed file content to disk incrementally just as their content becomes available by the &quot;unzip&quot;-engine. 
Therefore a 100MB file will initially start with a length of zero bytes and then grow incrementally in small steps. 
As the operation system initially never knows how large the file will become in the end the OS has to incrementally reserve new disk space for each and every of these &quot;growth&quot;-steps. 
-&gt; In most cases this will not be possible in a continuous manner on the hard disk - therefore creating many file fragments all over the disk even at the time of file creation. FIX/IMPROVEMENT: 
=&gt; Tell the OS how large the file will become in the end! 
-&gt; As this is during decompression 7-ZIP knows exactly how large each uncompressed file will be HOWTO: 
Just set the expected file size directly after initially creating the file. 
On Windows using the Win32 API this would look something like this (without any error checking): 
HANDLE hFile; 
LARGE_INTEGER liSize; 
hFile = CreateFile(&quot;somelargefile.bin&quot;, GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ, 0, CREATE_NEW, FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN, 0); 
liSize.LowPart = 1234567890; 
liSize.HighPart = 0; 
SetFilePointerEx(hFile, liSize , NULL, FILE_BEGIN); 
SetEndOfFile(hFile); 
SetFilePointer(hFile, 0, NULL, FILE_BEGIN); The SetEndOfFile call is were it all happens in the OS. 
On NTFS this call performs very fast and still pre-allocates the full physical disk space for the file (look up doc for SetEndOfFile and how it works together with SetFileValidData to avoid the need to zero-fill the complete file which would slow down things). CAVEAT: This method only works (i.e. prevent fragmentation) if the file is not configured as a SPARSE-file (supported by NTFS, ext3/4, and many others). 
On Windows CreateFile never creates a SPARSE-file, this would need an additional call to DeviceIoControl. 
However, I've no idea if this is also true for other OS/other FS - I think so, but I'm not 100% sure. On other OS the same principle applies just as long as the OS and the file-system drivers support using this &quot;size-hint&quot; to create less fragmented files. 
For example, AFAIK, Linux works partially like this as well (e.g. see &quot;shake&quot; defragmenter for Linux)... Thanks for creating the best archiving tool out there! 
This highly technical point really is my onlyissue with 7-ZIP... Cheers, 
Marble.</detail>

then there is no such problem, but when u have about  
100 archives with more that 1500 files in each,  
searching name, by name, by name, ... is no fun. And  
what if u r searching for a specific text in a a file which  
name u don't remember? Yeah, I know - u will say just  
extract those files, search them for the text and delete - 
but what if I don't have enought free space to extract  
the entire archive of 1500+ files to search? Extract 1,  
search, delete; extract, search, delete; extract... *  
1500 files * 100 archives (now that's work for a few

Unfornately i have a bunch of .ax files, which are directshow filter dlls. 7zip uses LZMA for .ax files by default. If I rename them to *.dll and rename back to *.ax after making the package, 7zip uses BCJ2 and gives much better compression. Is it possible for 7zip to support more PE files in extension other than .exe or .dll? Or use a prober instead of looking at extensions, since PE headers are easy to detect.</detail>

        <detail> I have a suggestion for the compression process. 
When you make a compression over files with redundancy errors (errors in disk or file) the process stops without finishing. The suggestion is that 7z skips the bad file showing a message and continues with the others ending with a return code indicating that some files haven't been compressed. 
This behaviour could be implemented throw a switch. An other suggestion is to distinguish in the test when the problem is one file in the compress file o the whole compress file, because if solely  there are a wrong file it could be treated different as if the whole compressed file is corrupted.</detail>

        <title>#884 Remove Redundant Folders From Extraction Path</title>
        <detail> I am requesting an extraction feature option in 7-zip to make it more convenient when extracting files: 
Remove Duplicate/Redundant Folders From Extraction Path (this is similar to the WinRAR extraction option)  This is what the feature does (taken from WinRAR change log):  3.60  New &quot;Remove duplicate folders from extraction path&quot; option in &quot;Settings/Compression&quot; dialog.  If this option is on and you unpack an archive which root folder has no files and only one 'somename' folder and if destination folder is new or empty and also ends with '/somename', WinRAR will exclude one 'somename' from resulting 'somename/somename' path.  3.90 
 &quot;Remove duplicate folders from extraction path&quot; option in &quot;Settings/Compression&quot; dialog is replaced by more universal &quot;Remove redundant folders from extraction path&quot; option. This option will eliminate redundant archive name based folders from extraction path if you unpack an archive with &quot;Extract to DestName\&quot; context menu command and if archive root folder contains only one folder and no files.</detail>

Making a small c:\ partition for windows system files and a big d:\ partition for the rest of the disk is a common practice, and 7zip is often useless in such conditions, because there may not be enough space for temp files on the first partition to unarchive to the second one. Many other archive managers have an option to set the path for temp files, and 7zip should have this option too.</detail>

        <title>#757 Two suggestions for LZMA SDK 4.58 beta LzmaDec.c</title>
        <detail> 1. The kLiteralNextStates array should be declared as const, i.e. 
const Byte kLiteralNextStates[kNumStates * 2] ... 2. I know it's just a few bytes :-)... but maybe the functions LzmaDec_InitRc() and LzmaProps_Decode() can use a macro, called something like GET_LE32, to read the 4 bytes from iput. 
This macro, defined in Types.h as the default (data[1] | ((UInt32)data[2] &lt;&lt; 8) | ((UInt32)data[3] &lt;&lt; 16) | ((UInt32)data[4] &lt;&lt; 24)) could be modified by the user to (*(LPWORD)data) for little-endian platforms (allowing misaligned reads).</detail>

        <title>#204 SFX options</title>
        <detail> Since I positively despise badly written, bad performing,  
loud and slow installers (most notably with games) I used  
to use winrar to create a SFX that contained the fully  
patched, extracted version of the game, with my own  
keybinds, savegames (if applicable). Usually this SFX is a LOT smaller than the original game  
too, installs a lot quicker (especially if you count the time  
I need to tweak the game's keys from defaults).  Then I put my new SFX on a DVD and send my game cd's  
to storage. For this I need 7z to support:  
1/ extracting files to a specific path (or ask for a path) 
2/ run a program after extraction (usually I let it 'run' a . 
reg file), obviously the program's location is relative to  
the extraction dir. (and I used it to add the icon of the game in question but  
I can live without that) The problem is, in the manuals for 7z I can't find the right  
options for #2 - the 'installer' SFX evidently deletes the  
temp files after closing and the non-installer version can't  
run programs (my .reg) afterwards.  Can someone please create a SFX installer that does  
this? Or am I just misreading the manual?</detail>

        <title>#505 Please read this</title>
        <detail> I fully support your work in promoting open source 
software, and yours goals. I would like to read this 
document carefully, rather than rejecting it out of hand. When looking for an open source alternative to winrar 
or winzip, I found yourselves.  You are however your own worse enemy:  
. I cannot install the software using an executable. 
I have to download the source code and compile it.  
. The integration with windows is weak:  
windows users use &quot;my documents&quot; and desktop.  By doing this you have restricted your audience to the 
small subset of people that have the stamina to fight 
your installation procedure, and put up with the weak 
integration. Open source is NOT about having to 
compile, it is about having the freedom to compile if 
you want it. If you want to prove that open source software can beat 
commercial software, you have to concentrate on 
usability not performance. The average user doesnt care 
about compression ratios, but instead wants an easy 
download, installation and easy usage. For example my mother and father are both in their 70s, 
and not very computer literate. I am trying to persuade 
them to use you instead of winrar, but I cannot just 
get them to click on a link, and follow instructions. 
They cannot remember how to navigate to their desktop 
or documents... to summarise they cannot use their 
software and instead have paid money to winrar. I am sorry if this sounds negative, I will repeat my 
opening comment: I think the software performs 
excellent, and I am willing to put up with the very 
real pain of installing and using it, as it is an open 
source alternative to winrar.</detail>

        <title>#964 Set compression level separately per each file via COM</title>
        <detail> Typically, when I am creating backup of a folder there are many files which are already compressed (files like 7z, zip, rar .. but also picture files, video files, cd images, docx file and many others). I am writing the program which could recognize the type of file (e.g. according to its magic number or extension) and then decide which compression level is suitable for the specific type (no compression for zip, 7z, iso, .. big compression level for txt, ... etc.). This would speed up compression process significantly and there would be almost no difference in compressed size comparing to the result where no such a method was used. I have written .NET wrapper where I can set the properties (including compression ratio) for the whole archive using  
    IOutArchive.SetProperties 
COM method. But there is no option to set compression ratio separately per each item. In SharpZipLib library I can specify the compression level per each item writing something like this: ZipEntry entry = new ZipEntry(name);  
string extension = Path.GetExtension(source).ToLower();  
entry.CompressionMethod = compressedExtensions.Contains(extension)  
                            ? CompressionMethod.Stored  
                            : CompressionMethod.Deflated;  I didn't find the way how to achieve this in 7-zip. Is there a solution?  
In my opinion this is key feature.</detail>

        <title>#523 File system attribute support - archive bit</title>
        <detail> Hi Igor, First, thank you for a great free archive package. May I ask for a feature that 7-zip can support the 
Archive bit on file systems to make 7-zip a better 
backup package? A switch on the command line version could give an 
option to add all files no matter what the archive bit 
is and clear the archive bit (--A-) after the file is 
added to an archive. To compare this with windows 
backup (ntbackup.exe), this would be a &quot;Normal&quot; backup. If 7-zip could then support adding files to a new 7z 
archive with only the filesystem archive bit set (which 
means they have been modified or created since the last 
backup), this would support &quot;Differential&quot; backups. If 7-zip could also support adding files to a new 7z 
archive with only the filesystem archive bit set AND it 
clears the archive bit of each file after the file is 
added to the new archive. This is identical to the 
windows &quot;Incremental&quot; backup. Otherwise I cannot fault the great 7-zip program! Thank you.</detail>

        <title>#538 Please make LZMA command line more like gzip and bzip2</title>
        <detail> Hi Igor, I am the Debian maintainer in charge of the LZMA 
package (a binary build 
from the LZMA_Alone directory of the SDK). In order to get lzma used in the Debian Packages 
structure, we need DPKG 
to support lzma as it supports gzip and bzip2. DPKG's maintainers and many other people would like 
lzma to have an 
interface similar to those tools (they reported bug 
reports to me, so I 
am just forwarding them). That is to say: % lzma --version 
LZMA 4.43 Copyright (c) 1999-2006 Igor Pavlov  2006-06-04 
% lzma -vvv -&gt; verbose versions but silent by default % lzma file 
-&gt; compressed file.lzma as output 
[ equivalent to the current % lzma e file file.lz ] % unlzma file.lz 
-&gt; uncompressed file as output 
[ equivalent to the current % lzma d file.lz file ] % echo foo | lzma 
-&gt; write encoded data to the terminal 
[ equivalent to the current % echo foo | lzma e 
-si -so ] % echo foo | lzma | unlzma 
-&gt; write foo to the terminal 
[ equivalent to the current % echo foo | lzma e 
-si -so | lzma d -si -so ] I think this should be really easy to implement for you 
and it has the 
advantage to make lzma a real competitor to gzip and 
bzip2 on Unix 
platforms. I am also working on having a tar flag for 
LZMA. And I think 
the maintainers will have the same concerns about the 
command-line 
interface of LZMA. Moreover, there is already some work done (see 
 ). It 
would be great to 
merge some of the functionnalities already there. What do you think? When would you be able to do it? As 
Debian is 
releasing soon, DPKG is going to be frozen really soon 
now. And if we do 
not provide the lzma feature now, we will have to wait 
a release cycle 
to get it integrated and then another one to see the 
feature really used 
(because of transition issues...). Anyways, thanks for considering.</detail>

        <title>#556 generate archive name using the current date and time</title>
        <detail> Please add support to automatically generate archive 
names equivalent to the winrar -AG[format] switch. 
This would permit automatic backup scripts to easily 
create unique named archives, complete with embedded 
date info. I am stuck with winrar until 7zip adds 
support for this. I did see #1395142, but it didn't 
seem to be very clear. example: -ag&quot; YYYY-MMM-DD HHMM&quot; 
This appends the date string specified to the archive 
name already provided, note the space I have included. 
Winrar will prefix the date string instead if it starts 
with a '+'. I think the '+' format specifier is a 
little counterintuitive, and I would prefer to 
depreciate it in favour of a replacement format 
specifier of L to cause any leafname specified to be 
embedded into the generated name, wherever placed in 
the format string. In the absence of an L specifier, 
then compatibility with the winrar syntax should (if 
possible) be maintained. Inclusion of both an initial + 
and an L should probably generate an error, but 
inclusion of multiple instances of L should perhaps be 
permitted. This switch also supports the N format specifier, which 
causes the archiver to search for any preexisting 
archive name, and create new names with incremental 
numbers if necessary. [personally, i find having 
hour(H), minute(M), and on rare occasions second(S) is 
sufficient for creating unique names, but i suppose 
someone may just want predictable incremental numbered 
names in some situations, and no date info]

        <title>#965 Better handling of multi-part archive extraction</title>
        <detail> 7-zip does not uncompress multi-part RAR archives properly.  Say I have a multi-part archive that starts with .RAR, .R00,.R01, ... .R99. In WinRAR you can click on any of the other files other then the one that has the .RAR extension and the archive will unzip properly.  However if you do that in 7-Zip if fails miserably, it seems to want to start uncompressing from that archive you've selected and fails instead of being smart enough to go to the beginning of the archive. I'd expect that if I click on MyArchive.R05 right click and go to extract all, that it would be smart enough to know that is not the beginning of the archive and find it's way to MyArchive.RAR and begin the extraction. Think of the scenario where you have 5 multi-part archives each 200 pieces all in one directory.  What this forces me to do is go search out all the files that begin with .RAR and extract them instead of clicking on any of the archive pieces from each of the five multi-part archives and extracting them. 
 Sure you could sort by .RAR then extract and then go back to your last view of the directory but that is unnecessary clicking. So I propose that you support the option of clicking on MyArchive.R05 or any of the .RXX files that are associated with 7Zip and have it proceed to find the beginning of the archive and then extract the files, just like the way WinRAR does it. 
 This would provide much needed flexibility in the programs usage. FYI, i'm refering the 7zip for windows. See forum post here for more information: </detail>

        <title>#599 Smart Layered Archiving/Extraction Function</title>
        <detail> In other words the ability to extract 2 or more levels of archive simultaneously without decoding the entire first level compression then the second. This might be VERY hard, but it's the ultimate challenge. Like the tar command in linux and unix, which can decode tar with gz or bz2 simultaneously by using a special tag, make 7-zip work like the tar, except using a expended version smart archive detection. make it read the header, scan the archive, if it only have one other archive in it, automatically extract the header and file information of the second archive, auto-detect the compression type of the second archive,then logs into the second archive. After when a person is extracting, the program will on-the-fly decodes both or more compression methods instead of opening the file, extracting the archive, opening it again, and extract it a second time. Of course, if this function is made, there will be other uses. For example, multiple large archives in a single mega-sized archive so often found on peer to peer networks, or corporation that has their enormous data backed-up into many single archives, then compress them together into a larger archive. If it is also possible, make it so that it can also directly run a exe from an archive, smart decode the exe so the launcher opens up, then the files needed will then  layer extract when needed. Like the nero trial version, except no more long extraction before setup, instant setup when double-clicked, saving at least 20 min on slow machines. So in a sense, replacing explorer in a way. Except with greater compression than disks with compression enabled. I though up of this idea while waiting for the ultra-large directx sdk to download. And in the end? Guess what? three extraction processes. One that extracts it from a self-extracting exe, into another self-extracting archive. Then after, a setup that extract more stuff. Seriously, all that time extracting. Have to mount up to at least an hour on slow machines. I can't code that good yet, (my knowledge only goes as far as manipulation of build in function and variables) that's why I requested this request instead of joining the 7-zip developer program.</detail>

        <detail> Currently 7-Zip MSI seems to have no support for options, just default install without registering extensions. 
I would like some user-configurable properties, such as registering file extensions on install. 
Currently, when installing 7-Zip with Group Policy, extensions don't get registered and there seems to be no support for automatically registering them. Therefor i have to manually (deployed automatically, but extracted manually from testing PCs) create a lot of registry keys that might change between versions or not be up to date (old icons, new extensions not recognized, changed paths). 
If i could create a transform (MST) and set (for example) REGISTERALLEXTENSIONS to 1 (or if for specific extensions REGISTER7Z, REGISTERRAR etc), installer would automatically register required extensions. 
This could be extended, for example default language, install path etc.

uncomfortable: I can't drag and drop files from other

associate 7-Zip only with BZ2 extensions that are not 
handled by Winzip. But when drag and drop also works in 
7-zip, it would be the best candidate to replace my old 
Winzip.</detail>

        <title>#1111 free splitted zip-files like winzip does</title>
        <detail> Hello, 7-zip is the best file-compressor on the web. But I am missing two features: 1. I want to choose freely the size where an archive has to be splitted (like 15MB oder 16MB or any other file-size) 2. The second thing I am missing is probably more tricky. When I split a file with 7-zip the file has to be joined for decompressing or you have to use 7-zip. Since not every one uses 7-zip or other archiver which can join such files and a lot of people are not allowed to install such program (e.g. in a company), it is necessary that an archive can be decompressed with a program included in windows. For explaination: 
winzip can create splitted zip-archives that can be decompressed by the windows own decompressor. If you can manage this I think winzip and other compressing program will loose a lot of users. I hope you will add this. If there are any questions left contact me at . hannespi</detail>

        <title>#1055 Preserve file order</title>
        <detail> When creating EPUB files (zip files with an .epub extension), a file called &quot;mimetype&quot; has to be added first (and uncompressed). The usual trick with other archivers is to add &quot;mimetype&quot; in a first run and then update/freshen the archive with the rest of the files. This works, because the same file isn't added twice. 7z (command line version) always rewrites the whole archive and mimetype just happens to be last. Could you improve the update command so as to preserve the order of the files which are already in the archive or provide some other means of sorting?</detail>

        <title>#385 7z command-line : no option to overwrite archive</title>
        <detail> Unless I'm wrong in my findings, there is no way for the  
command-line 7z to &quot;overwrite&quot; an existing archiving.  
Something like a 'c' action (Create) which would be  
similar to 'a' (Add) but would overwrite the previous  
archive. Today the only way to create a new archive 'test.7z' is  
to make sure that file does not exist yet, then to issue  
something like : 7z a test.7z myfiles If test.7z does not exist, it will be created. 
If test.7z already exists, there is NO way to tell 7z to  
overwrite it. This can usefull when using temporary files in more  
complex scripts. For instance I need to get a temp file  
name from Windows. Then I need to create an archive of  
that name. This is not easy. Because when windows  
gives you a temp file name, it creates the file with 0  
bytes content. Hence the file already exists for 7z and  
7z fails with an error about the file being not a supported  
archive format (correct, it is right). So the only solution is to delete the temp file returned  
by windows just before running 7z. But this opens the  
risk that windows could assign that same file name to  
another temp file name request while or before 7z runs. A switch for the action 'a' that would allow to overwrite  
the existing archive or maybe better a completetly  
distinct action 'c' (Create) would be really usefull. It  
would have exactly the same options and semantic as  
action 'a' (Add), except that it would always create a  
new archive, overwriting the archive name if it already  
exists.</detail>

        <title>#182 Please UPX *.SFX in your project</title>
        <detail> Hi have you ever heard of UPX?  It's a lossleless 
compressor for .exe files.  They are compressed and 
decompressed in memory just before executing.  You can 
read about it in greater detail and get a copy at 
HTTP://UPX.SF.NET. UPX is simply a must have. 
Here's an example of what it can do to .EXEs: ----------------------------------------------------------- 
Application        Original            Compressed   Ratio 
----------------------------------------------------------- 
Netscape 4.06   netscape.exe    2,934,336     1,124,352    
Descent 2     descent2.exe    1,448,873         652,832    
MAME 0.36    mame.exe    8,214,016     1,810,056   
OneOhOne    101.exe       438,144        179,566   
Emacs 20.2   emacs-20.2      2,772,657     925,543 
g++ 2.8.1     cc1plus.ttp      1,595,049          655,508

Total                                    17,403,075   
5,347,857 Please UPX *.SFX (your self-extracting .exes) so that 
they'll be as small as possible.  I've already tested 
out this lossless compression on your program and it 
works great.

        <title>#553 Slow packing of zip files</title>
        <detail> I do not know why, but there is a really slow  
implementation to add zip files into an archive.  I have tested it in comparison with Total Commander  
zip plugin. And the same files Total Commander  
compress with -9 compression ratio in about one minute  
(1-1,20) and 7zip (with 'best' ratio) try to compress  
in about 3,5-4! (and the filesize is about the same). The same situation exists when compresing in -6 ratio  
(and normal in 7zip). So there is no comparison in that way TC is  
incomparably much faster. Why it happends? Thanks in advance.</detail>

        <title>#304 Directories in archives and command line, ideas.</title>
        <detail> Hi Igor, I have some ideas how to store directory names in  
archives. Assume you introduce -c as indicator  
about which directory names to store. Now an example: File to store in archive: c:\sub1\sub2\sub3\test.ini In the command line with a new switch -c, following  
directories would be archived: [with -c0 (default)] 
\test.ini [with -c-1] 
\sub3\test.ini [with -c-2] 
\sub2\sub3\test.ini [with -cr (r=root) it always saves till root + drive] 
\c\sub1\sub2\sub3\test.ini You see what I mean. With positive values, files  
from subfolders could be merged into unique  
directories the same way. Not sure if this is needed  
somewhere. Folders in archives are very important for backing up  
purposes! Thanks for a great product and happy new year.</detail>

        <title>#813 Compression Improvement - identify files inside CD images</title>
        <detail> Firstly lets start with an example. 
Try compressing a .iso image normally (with no subchannel or copyprotection data) 
Now compress the contents of the .iso as indiviual files. 
You will note that compressing the files individually provides a much better compression ratio. It would be fantastic if 7Zip could understand popular image formats nativly and compress the image by trying to identify the files rather than compressing one big data stream. May I suggest a way to do this: 
When a supported CD image format is detected of being compressed, 7zip identifies the indiviual files and their location inside the CD image, compresses them just as if they were loose files on your hard drive, identify the subchannel data along with all the other bits that are not files, (their location in the image too) and compress that like a special file. 
When decompressing, 7zip uses the available info to recreate the cd/dvd image in its exact original form.</detail>

Basically when extracting, it will compare with an already given time frame (time frame will be given as an input) lets say 24 hours, so after 24 hours if someone wants to extract the zip file it will compare the time of creation vs the time of extraction (local time is fine) and if its &gt; 24 hours it will NOT extract anything rather show a customized msg and if it is &lt; 24 hours it will extract the zip file as a normal operation.</detail>

        <title>#282 Administrative Deployment</title>
        <detail> When the program is installed, the registry and menu 
entries are created for the user who installs the 
program ONLY. 
So, when another user logs on to the system, the 
program cannot be used (or even seen). In a corporate 
environment (where hundreds of users could possibly log 
on to the same computer) it is difficult to introduce 
such a program. 
I would like to see this problem solved. Another good feature (strictly related to the former) 
is the possibility to deploy it via software 
distribution systems, giving the program a &quot;silent 
install&quot; feature (writing a response file or providing 
command line switches) Otherwise, the program is a good one.

        <title>#230 File splitting, fm default selection, SFX modules, linux....</title>
        <detail> First I'd like to thank you for building the only 
archiver that rivals winrar for flexibility and power. There are, however, a couple of things missing for this 
program to be fully mature:  -The first and most important being diskspanning and 
splitting of archives. (Both compressing and 
decompressing). -The second one is an annoying habit of the file 
manager. When you open an archive, it selects by 
default only the first file in the archive. It would be 
much more ergonomic if the entire archive was selected 
for extraction by default. -Some extra SFX modules would be nice, allowing 
cross-platform extracting. I'd suggest a SFX for dos, 
os/2, linux and unix. -Off course a great application like this should be 
running on linux. I know win to lin is hard to port. 
Maybe I'll pick this one up myself one day if I find 
some time. Thanks for a great app, I'm looking forward to seeing 
it being developed further. Jeroen Bouwen

        <title>#711 Password management within file manager</title>
        <detail> It'd be really nice if you could add/edit/delete passwords within existing archives via the file manager.  Right now the only real option for adding passwords to archives is to put add your archive to a NEW archive at &quot;store&quot; level compression and add a password to the outside one.  The only way to delete the password from your archive (other than the way described in the bug fixes forum) is to extract all and rearchive.  The same goes for changing the password.  I think it could work the same way I suggested in the post for that password deletion bug.  If you want to delete the password, it would prompt you for your old password and then simply unencrypt the current archive (or as I seem to recall, it recreates the archive within a temp file in the same directory and then overwrites the original).  If you wanted to change the password it would just prompt for the new password after it prompted for the old one and then it would simply apply the new password.  I realize this probably would not be able to be implemented on .rar archives because it would most likely involve rebuilding the archive, which is a no-no with winrar's proprietary algorithm, but still, it would be nice, at least with the native .7z format.</detail>

        <title>#541 Add ability to remove file attributes</title>
        <detail> 7-zip is a great tool.  My use of 7-zip would be  
simplified if the tool containd options to not  
preserve file attibutes.  Specifically, I need to  
extract files and remove the Windows file attributes  
(especially ro) in one step.  This problem could be solved via check box options or  
command line switches in either the packing or  
extraction process.  In my case, I really need the  
option to be available in the extraction process  
since I can't be sure the original package does not  
contain files with read only attributes. Changing the file attributes after extraction is  
simple but very tedious.  Having 7-zip perform the  
same function during extraction would solve the  
problem. Thanks for a great tool!</detail>

        <title>#946 Improvements to installer</title>
        <detail> Hi, first of all, a big thank you for 7-Zip! I just updated from 9.12 to 9.13 and was asked to reboot my computer. Is this really necessary? I guess its for the explorer extension, but is this extension really updated with every 7-Zip update? It would be nice if I didnt need to reboot after installation. It would also be nice if I would have the option to create startmenu entries or not. I have the orginal ones moved to another submenu and with every update,  have to delete the newly created ones. FileZilla does this quite perfectly. There is an NSIS makro/function to store what the user choosed last. Lars</detail>

        <detail> One of the main features I found in WinRAR that I 
haven't found in 7-zip is forward error correction. 
This is essential when sending stuff over the net, or 
storing files on CDs that degrade over time. If even 
one bit is faulty, the files can't be reconstructed. I 
used a binary editor to bit twiddle a .7z file to 
observe the outcome.  I liked the fact that if I downloaded something made 
with WinRAR, I had a real great chance of not having to 
download it again. Wayne</detail>

        <detail> When do &quot;extract here&quot; on an archive, its content is extracted directly to destination (current) folder. 
But if you first open it and then star extract from displayed contents list, files are first copied to system temporary folder and then back to destination folder. It is significantly longer especially on medium and large archives. It is necessary to open archives before extract them, because some contains bunch of files directly in archive root, in this case &quot;extract in %name%&quot;. Some archives contains one folder, in this case &quot;extract here&quot;. Now you are constrained to two not optimal ways: 
1) first inspect each archive, close it and only then extract it quickly (by context menu). 
2) open it and extract slowly. OS: Windows XP</detail>

However, when the person you're sending it too is not very technical (i.e. not used to installing software - even if it's as good as 7zip) it would be nice to have a sfx-module. 
At this point, both features are available in 7zip, but can not be combined.  So what I'm requesting is that 7zip would be able to split a file in multiple smaller pieces and have one of them being double-clickable (executable) so that computer illeterates can recover the original file without installing software.</detail>

often forward the same messages to one another, I thought I could  
gain some space by sorting the messages by size (the files have  
machine-generated unique names, so you gain nothing by sorting  
according to them). To do this, I wrote  
a short perl script, which then feeds the files to 7za through @list. 
However, it appears that 7z resorts the files. Could this be avoided?</detail>

After I set the attached registry, restart my machine, I can open the file from IE, and there is the open option. Do you plan to insert these registry entries to your MSI file?

        <detail> If I'm archiving a large directory containing a mix of, for example, compressible text and pre-compressed JPEG files, the process could be speeded up considerably if 7-ZIP didn't attempt to re-compress the already compressed JPEGs. Add a 'check-box' option to allow the user to instruct 7-ZIP to revert to 'store only' mode when it encounters a file extension that indicates the file is most likely pre-compressed. Also add a text entry box to allow the user to enter a comma separated list of 'store-only' file extensions. 
Set default box contents to a list of well known extensions that virtually always indicate the file is already compressed: 
7Z, ZIP, BZ2, JPEG, JPG, PNG, MPEG, MPG, MP3, MP4, AAC, WMA, WMV, M4A, 3GP, FLV, VOB, AVI, MOV</detail>

        <title>#865 Simple interface improvements for efficiency</title>
        <detail> I don't really need to spend much time at all when working with compressed files -- I almost always just want to unzip the things wherever they need to go and be done with it all.  I usually download a zip file and open it directly from my browser (the explorer context menu options are perfect to me). Suggestions for improvement: 
-  allow the user to set a default action for what happens when an archive is opened (GUI mode).  My default action would be &quot;extract files...&quot; just like is offered in the explorer context menu. 
-  path autocompletion.  Please add path autocompletion to your text boxes!  I end up using Vista's start menu just to obtain the path I want, which I then paste into 7-zip... I've tried out every compression utility I could find, and 7-zip is still my favorite.  With these small changes, it will finally be perfect as far as my needs are concerned.  Thanks for the great software!</detail>

        <title>#716 A option for spanning</title>
        <detail> I want to compress a lot of files into a set of compressed files. But, difference from spanning is files will not be divided between compressed files. So each compressed file can be decompressed independently. We  can adjust the maximum size of compressed files, or file count in compressed files. If the files can't be canned in a particular compressed file size, then it will be optional to span or not. Thanks eifiel@superonline.com</detail>

        <detail> WinRAR has a most useful feature off the command line 
which it calls the &amp;quot;-ag switch&amp;quot;. I prefer to create new archives rather than 
updating/overwriting them. The -ag switch in WinRAR 
allows me to append a date/time formatted string to my 
archive name, e.g. -agYYYY-MM-DD-HHMM This produces a unique archive name whenver I run 
WinRAR. The format is user defined. If used with an archive name of &amp;quot;Widget-&amp;quot; would produce 
archive names like: Widget-2003-12-10-1155.7z Thanks!</detail>

        <title>#398 Compression improvements ideas</title>
        <detail> could be a good idea to add options for 
1 - file type recognition based also on file contents 
(not just file extension): this could improve 
compression when compressing setup directories where 
often files extension are renamed (e.g. EXE -&gt; EX_) 
2 - compressed (images, audio, archives and so on) file 
recompression by prior stream decompression: e.g. take 
a jpeg image and decompress the huffman-encoded stream, 
then recompress it with a better algorithm (that's what 
people at stuffit are doing) 
3 - in solid mode, group similar (extension and/or 
content) files together (two-passes mode?): could 
improve compression if solid mode is applied only to 
separated subsets of &quot;similar&quot; files instead of the 
whole list? 
4 - if file appears more than once in the archive, use 
references instead of storing the file again hope you may find these ideas useful, 
CAFxX.</detail>

        <title>#877 Tweak to file sorting to recognize dates</title>
        <detail> When adding files to an archive 7-zip sorts by filename.  But this doesn't give the best results when you have files with odd date formats, for example Stuff 1-Jan-2007.txt 
Stuff 2-Jan-2007.txt 
Stuff 3-Jan-2007.txt 
... 
Stuff 1-Feb-2007.txt 
Stuff 2-Feb-2007.txt 
... In these cases, the default sorting puts '1-Jan-2007' next to '1-Jan-2008', when usually you'd get better compression putting it next to '2-Jan-2007'. The heuristic used for sorting, instead of doing a simple alphanumeric comparison, should recognize strings that are likely to be dates and try to sort in date order. I know, it's better to use ISO 8601 format dates, but there are a lot of other date formats still in use...</detail>

        <title>#962 Idea for lowering file size of solid multi-block 7Z files</title>
        <detail> Currently, the method to assign files to blocks in 7Z files goes something 
like this: 1. Group files by extension 
2. Sort groups alphabetically 
3. Sort files within groups alphabetically 4. Start at top of list, try to add file to the block. Repeat. 
5. When block doesn't have room, start a new block. This often results in blocks that are much smaller than the user-specified block 
size, and often uses more blocks than are necessary, which typically makes the final 7Z file size larger than they need to be. 
I would recommend: 1. Group files by extension 
2. Sort groups by file size (decreasing) 
3. Sort files within groups by file size (decreasing) 4. Start at top of list, try to add an entire group to the block. Repeat. 
5. When block doesn't have room for any more complete groups, start at top of list (disregarding groupings) and add a single file 
to the block. Repeat. 
6. When block doesn't have room for any more files at all, re-sort remaining groups by file size and start a new block. This should result in blocks being packed as tightly as possible, while still 
favoring the current logic of trying to keep files with the same extension 
in the same block. This will increase 7-Zip usefulness in low-RAM environments where block sizes are the limiting factor.</detail>

        <title>#243 direct .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 support</title>
        <detail> A bit of congratulations first: 
I tried version 3.13 and since love your program. 
It's fast and light, handles most archive &amp; compression  
formats (including those coming from Unix), and has a  
GUI entirely usable from keyboard. Plus it has few  
settings, but they are the good ones, so after I install it  
somewhere I don't loose 1/2 hour checking settings. Then the feature request: 
Currently, I have to proceed in two steps to build or  
extract .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 archives. It would be a lot  
more convenient if those archive types could be handled  
in one step. 
NB: Being able to handle .tar, .gz and .bz2 separately  
should *not* be removed, it's useful at times to build  
uncompressed tar archives or compress single files.</detail>

        <title>#1113 Skip compression on already compressed formats</title>
        <detail> This is based on the assumption that you can apply different compression levels to different files within an archive?  (that's possible right?) It would be great if when creating an archive, there was a tick box option called &quot;Don't compress compressed formats&quot; or &quot;Skip compression on compressed formats&quot; or something like that. This would by default compress all files using the user's select compression ratio.  But well known compressed formats such as &quot;zip 7z mp3 jpg avi mpg etc...&quot; would simply be stored in the archive uncompressed as if it was a &quot;Compression level: Store&quot; archive.  This would save huge amounts of time when creating large archives that contain both compressible and fairly uncompressable files.</detail>

        <title>#950 Symlinks under Windows</title>
        <detail> When 7-zip can unpack TAR and TGZ archives which can contain also symlinks it is good idea to add support for recreating links also under Windows. The NTFS supports several kinds of links. At least junction point and hardlinks (both as integrated type of reparse point) are supported by WinAPI starting Windows 2000. Moreover Windows Vista adds support for real symlinks (according to POSIX). In the FAT file system is structualy possible to make symlink but it is counted as file system error therefore there can be option to let user decide if he want copy of symlink target, or create Explorer shell link (the LNK file), or do nothing (create a text file with path to target).</detail>

        <title>#794 compression improvement: better duplicate file handling</title>
        <detail> Compression improvement: better duplicate file handling This is a feature request that can significantly improve the compression ratio of archives that have duplicate files in them, particularly if the duplicated files are larger than the dictionary size.  The name and location of these files does not matter (i.e. they may be in the same folder under different names, under different folders, etc.). Use cases: 
1.) improving compression ratios of solid and non-solid archives 2.) backups of filesystems with hardlinks in them 3.) drive backups of the whole filesystem, including programs: there are many gigabytes of duplicated DLLs in a complete file-based backup of a Windows drive.  Many of these duplicates come from programs keeping a copy of DLLs in their own folder. 4.) Driverpacks (  ) also have many duplicated DLLs in them due to how they must be organized into multiple folders to separate drivers One possible algorithm: 
1.) During the standard 7-Zip compression process a CRC is generated for each file.  Record this CRC and the file size together in a table. 2.) as part of adding each new file to the archive, compare the CRC and file size of the new file to the table of all other files already in the archive. 3.) If there isn't a CRC and file size match, continue processing the file as 7-Zip normally would.  (Traditional processing technique) 4.) If there IS a CRC and file size match, begin a byte-for-byte comparison of the two files to verify 100% that they are identical.  (This byte-for-byte comparison *might* be replaced with a very strong hashing function, but that's still not as safe as a true byte-for-byte comparison.  The default CRC32 is strong enough to quickly weed out non-identical files, but not strong enough to ensure they are truly identical.  After all, users expect lossless compression to be guaranteed with 7-Zip.) 5.) If the byte-for-byte comparison succeeds (the files are truly identical), add an entry in the 7-Zip file table that upon decompression directs 7-Zip to use the same compressed source bytes of data as for the identical file.  On Unix-like systems this would be like a creating a hardlink to a file (a pointer to the same data + a reference counter). 6.) If the byte-for-byte comparison failed, continue processing the file as 7-Zip normally would. (and possibly note somewhere in the archive that even though the CRC matches, the files were not identical). ---- Note: an enhancement of this algorithm would be to check the filesystem for hardlink between the two files in question, and use that as an alternative to the byte-for-byte comparison.  (If they're hardlinked to the same place, there is no reason to do the byte-for-byte comparison.)  Fully implemented, this might use recreate hardlinks upon restoration.  (NTFS does support hardlinks, just not via the GUI).</detail>

        <title>#550 7z file manager: open zip-like non-zip files outside</title>
        <detail> When opening a .zip (or .7z) archive that contains an  
open office document or a jar application, 7-zip by  
default opens them inside (since they are formally 
.zip files). Explicitly opening them outside works  
but is cumbersome if lots of documents have to be  
opened from the archive. It would be (IMHO) more appropriate to only open zip  
files inside by default if they are called .zip. Of  
course, one can still override this decision by  
explicitly opening the file inside. Or add an option to configure this behaviour. Michael</detail>

        <detail> 7zip (the GUI, at least) doesn't support removing the SFX module from a self-extracting archive. To do so manually (e.g. with dd) requires knowing the byte offset of the archive within the file. This is a pretty central piece of information for a self-extracting archive and worthy of being shown in the archive info either directly (&quot;archive offset&quot;) or indirectly (&quot;SFX module size&quot;). FreeArc is an example of an archiver that reveals this information, taking the latter approach.</detail>

        <detail> Hi, I like the &quot;Update&quot; command line options (-ux1y1 etc.) very much and am using these for creating incremental (or reverse incremental) personal backups. For that purpose it would be cool if .7z did not only support &quot;deletion&quot; special entries, but also &quot;update&quot; special entries, that update an existing file on extraction. I am thinking on formats like vcdiff or xdelta, which are somehow based on compression algorithms. So that if you change only a small part in a 10MB file, the diff is only a few kb or b. I am not sure if this is possible (there are tools for this but they are lacking speed and good compression), but it would definitely be great (vcdiff on LZMA should perform better than the standard vcdiff that uses Deflate, shouldn't it?)</detail>

Also double click an executable file inside an archive and decompress the whole archive to a temporary directory in order to execute the program correctly. Right now double clicking an audio file leads to decompress it to a temporal directory and when default player for that file tries to play it it can't find the file because it was already deleted. And with executable files it decompresses only that file and executes it, so any file that could be needed to execute properly won't be found at all.</detail>

panel.  This may interfere future implementation of drop  
down menu on top of the window, which eventually  
reserves Alt-left/right for navigating previous and next

document interface and open new folder view, which is  
already done with 'Open Outside' command in File  
menu.  Within each subwindow, the vertical split bar  
should split the file and directory list.  Status bar should  
be shared across document to give more space per

The G/UID are two 32 bit integers associated with file owner and file group, unique on an installation (like are unique group/username). 
G/UID=0 is used by root. The max supported value is 2^31-1. 
Association between G/UID and group/usernames, is done by those files: 
/etc/passwd (for user) 
/etc/group (for group) 
and the corresponding system call. 
For example to see files G/UID, a simple command parameter is needed: 
$ ls -ln 
while: 
$ ls -l 
show the complete groups and usernames. 
Note: Every files can be part of many groups, but 99% of applications need the main group only, so also a partial support is appreciated.</detail>

        <title>#771 Recompress existing archives</title>
        <detail> I would like to see an optional feature whereby if you are creating an archive, and some of the files being added are themselves archives that 7-zip supports, instead of trying to compress the archive, it on-the-fly writes a header indicating the original archive type and compression format, then decompresses the embedded archive to memory and recompresses the data using whatever options are in effect for the outer archive being created. Then when such an archive is decompressed, the header is parsed, and the content from the nested archive is recompressed into its original format before being written to disk. This would mean if you were creating a .7z archive that contained .zip files, you would get a much smaller .7z archive as it can compress the raw data extracted from the zips better than the zip files themselves. The cost, of course, would be slower extract times, and it would probably be impractical to make it compatible with SFX archives.</detail>

        <title>#212 On the fly packaging feature</title>
        <detail> I'm looking for a packer with the following ability: Storing many files in 1 virtual combined file on the fly.  
This would help to save diskspace if someone needs the  
single files in an uncompressed form on the harddisk, but  
want to save the diskspace for the packed file. 
I intend to store some 1000 pictures in a single  
collection-file (compression is not necessary). This  
collection file should be shared over a P2P-Network and  
it should be only simulated virtually. This means that  
every access to the packed file should be simulated and  
the packer should refer to the unpacked pictures on the  
harddisk. I think that it would be the best to generate  
an extra virual drive letter which shows these simulated  
collections and it would help to implement this feature if  
there would be generated a small control file for each  
collection. Any comments to this suggestion would be greatly  
appreciated.</detail>

So everytime I want to compress something else, I have to change all the 7-Zip parameters in the &quot;Add to archive..&quot; dialog. 
In any use case similar to mine, compression profiles would greatly make things easier and faster. WinRAR already has this option for a long time:  _big.gif</detail>

        <title>#1121 Command line - Feature Request</title>
        <detail> Dear developers. As a long time rar user, one of these days I decided to search for a free open-source alternative to it the way I could replace my backup script (Windows batch), so I chose 7z beacause of it's features. It's open-source, very good compression ratio compared to rar and supports AES encryption. 
First of all I'm going to describe what I use with rar so you can better understand: 
Fast compression ratio 
Include and exclude files from list using  
Create a archive name in the form archive_date(yyyymmdd)-time(hhmmss).rar Here is the command I use: 
rar a -r -k -m1 -p&quot;password&quot; -ep3 -x@exclude_list.txt -ag_yyyymmdd-hhmmss archive.rar @include_list.txt As I was testing I found the problems discribed bellow that frustated my switch to 7z and kept me with rar. Problem 1: 
As the files lists from .txt files include files from multiple locations (including multiple drives), I need to use the switch -ep3 in rar to store the full paths including the drive letter. This is crutial because I need to know from here the files come from when I made the backup. 
I couldn't achieve the same with 7z because I was unable to find any similar option in the 7z switches list. I tested 7z with  option but no full paths were stored, so I ended up with a bunch of files and directories that didn't make much sense. 
With rar we have the following switches: 
ep            Exclude paths from names 
ep1           Exclude base directory from names 
ep2           Expand paths to full 
ep3           Expand paths to full including the drive letter Problem 2: 
As you may had notice in my rar command, I append the current date and time to the name of the archive for obvious reasons. 
I also could not achieve this with 7z because I didn't found any switch that could allow me to do the same. But this time yes, I was able to append the date and time as I did with rar using the command date from CoreUtils (Windows version of date command sucks). But I think this feature should be implemented. The rar switch that allows append current date and time no the archive name: 
ag[format]    Generate archive name using the current date I think that for using 7z to make backup routines these features are extremelly importante and should be implemented. Thank you,

        <title>#814 Support for Mac archives</title>
        <detail> Formats: Stuffit (.sit and .sitx), MacBinary(.bin) (uncompressed), and BinHex(.hqx) in particular. .bin is trivial, and .hqx shouldn't be too hard. Note that on Macintosh systems, a file may have more than one &quot;fork&quot; of data, unlike most other operating systems, and this is reflected in the archive formats. Often, only the data fork is wanted/need be extracted. But sometimes the resource fork, or both, are needed. In that case, there a couple of conventions, so offer a choice: 
1. Append &quot;.data&quot; to the name of the extracted data fork and &quot;.rsrc&quot; to the name of the extracted resource fork. (Also, I've seen connected &quot;.info&quot; files, but I don't know about them). 
2. Decompress to MacBinary, since it is so simple (128-byte header, followed by each fork padded to a multiple of 128 bytes). Information on various formats:

FAR plugin I was referring to last time, which makes  
the plugin look nicer. First I would like to thank the 7-Zip developers for  
fixing my last request so fast. But I had some problems with the code last time, so  
the source change wasn't correct since I posted some  
incomplete source. So here is the hopefully correct  
source. (I can't check since I don't have MS VC++ 6) In the FAR directory, the file &amp;quot;Plugin.cpp&amp;quot; must be  
changed from: 
========== 
m_PannelTitle = CSysString(' ') +  
m_ArchiverInfo.Name + ':' + name + 
CSysString(' '); 
if(!m_CurrentDir.IsEmpty()) 
{ 
// m_PannelTitle += '\\'; 
m_PannelTitle += m_CurrentDir; 
} 
========== 
to 
==========  
m_PannelTitle = CSysString(' ') +  
m_ArchiverInfo.Name + ':' + name; 
if(!m_CurrentDir.IsEmpty()) 
{ 
// m_PannelTitle += '\\'; 
m_PannelTitle += m_CurrentDir; 
} 
m_PannelTitle += CSysString(' '); 
========== 
to fix the cosmetical error. Else it would show: 
&amp;quot; ZIP:abc.zip \directory&amp;quot; 
with the space before the &amp;quot;\&amp;amp;quot; and not at the end. Sorry  
for making myself unclear last time.</detail>

        <title>#672 (win version) - auto extract when double-clicking EXEs</title>
        <detail> 7-zip has so far been an incredible replacement 
for winRAR in my case. One thing I miss though : 
When double-clicking an executable inside an 
archive, winrar would extract all files to the 
temp folder, so you can run your program. 7-zip 
will just extract the executable, and very often 
it won't work since it needs the other files. Also, the option to &quot;remove files when done&quot; when 
compressing would also be nice. Those two small things are the only &quot;problems&quot; I 
could find with 7-zip !! Thanks for this incredible piece of software. CSB</detail>

        <title>#173 &amp;quot;Extract To&amp;quot; should remember last extract folder</title>
        <detail> When right-clicking in Windows Explorer to extract a 
file, the  &amp;quot;extract to&amp;quot; option always default to a 
sub-dir of the extract file. I.e., if the file is say, 
c:\download\extracting.7z, &amp;quot;extract to&amp;quot; will default to 
&amp;quot;c:\download\extracting\&amp;amp;quot;, REGARDLESS of what the last 
extract folder was. What I have to do is to click the 
dropdown menu, and select the last extract folder. This 
unnecessary clicks wasted a lot of time, for an 
experienced user. It would be more useful if the &amp;quot;extract to&amp;quot; option can 
remember which folder was last used, rather than 
default to a sub-dir. Examples of such &amp;quot;remembering&amp;quot; 
feature are: PowerArchiver, IZArc. Overall, 7-Zip is a GREAT program: small, efficient, 
yet can handle most of the common zip formats. If 
coupled with this enhanced &amp;quot;remember last folder&amp;quot; 
feature, it can easily beat all the other zip-wares flat!</detail>

Where it is already implemented? This option (&quot;--brute&quot; and its modification ¡ª &quot;--ultra-brute&quot;) is already implemented in UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables). Notes.

paramenters say  ....  
ExecuteFile=&quot;Cmd.exe&quot;  
ExecuteParameters=&quot;/c test.bat&quot;  
...  
My requirement is that when test.bat is run, the cmd  
window should now be displayed.  
As per windows property if we give any command say in  
the following format in run :  
cmd /c dir  
then in that case the command dir is executed but cmd  
window is not shown.  According to the properties of 7zip config file as  
mentioned in 7zip help, If I give the windows command  
under &quot;ExecuteFile&quot; and the required parameters  
in &quot;ExecuteParameters&quot; then the command will be as  
per normal windows command.  
But in the above case the cmd window is still shown  
when test.bat is running.  Can anyone suggest how to hide cmd.exe window when  
test.bat is running based on  
the config.txt format...for 7z sfx archive.  Thanks </detail>

        <title>#1084 7z command line logging</title>
        <detail> When syntax is correct 7z works fairly flawlessly creating and unpacking archives.  However, whenever a syntax error or archive creation/extraction error occurs it becomes essential for automation to parse the log file to verify an error has occurred.  Working with the windows command prompt output redirect is not always the cleanest solution.  Often I find working with script languages that call shellexecute( ) easier and cleaner with less probability of generating syntax errors due to sloppy placement of a rogue apostrophe or quotation marks. I believe that adding a command line logging switch to 7zip would be a project essential.  The &quot;-l&quot; is taken already for listing files in an archive.  I propose 7zip use either &quot;-lo&quot; for log output or &quot;-log&quot;.  The user specified value would be the full file path and file name for the log generated.  The default behavior should be to append to file if it exists rather than overwrite or provide any options since the user can easily control this by other means via unique file naming or deleting the existing file if they so please.</detail>

        <title>#422 Speed up drag and drop</title>
        <detail> I really like drag and drop because it often makes it 
easier to extract files/folders to a specific 
directory. When you choose &quot;Extract here...&quot; from the 
context menu it is not always clear whether the top 
level directory is included too, and when you choose 
&quot;Extract...&quot; from within the program you still have to 
browse to the destination directory, although you might 
have it open already. One thing I noticed however when extracting (large) 
files using drag and drop is that it takes longer to 
extract files that way because it looks like the files 
are first extracted (to a temporary directory?) and 
then copied to the destination directory. This way it 
takes time to first extract the files and then to copy 
them to the destination directory. Wouldn't it be possible to extract the files to the 
destination folder directly? For large archives this 
could speed up the extraction a lot I think. By the way, just to be clear, I really like this program !</detail>

        <title>#797 Have the ability to set the archive to zip globally</title>
        <detail> I work in a corporation that is looking into utilizing 7zip as its compression utility as a standard. I understand that the 7z format has better compression but training end users on the difference between 7z and the better know zip format is darn near impossible. I have taken the route to import a reg poke to set the archive type to zip when any new account logs in to a PC. This is solely based on an end user training point.  It is my suggestion to change the file format settings from [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\7-Zip\Compression] 
to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\7-Zip\Compression]. Or give the option upon install if you would like only the current user to have this product then install to current user, if they would like to install for all users then use the Local machine Hive for the settings. Again this is strictly to avoid the overbearing task it is to train users the simple difference and I do understand why this may not be considered. However if you do find a possibile fit for this change I know more corporations could take a look at this product as their standard compression utility.</detail>

Then I could tell if I needed to extract all or just a portion of the overall archive. It makes way more sense in my head...</detail>

compression setting to achieve the same original file, 
and compress the uncompressed files to result in a 
smaller file.  When uncompressed, the files are 
uncompressed and recompressed under the appropriate 
settings that were stored.</detail>

For example: You are downloading a multi-part .7z archive of 10 100mb files but were not able to get the last file, unless you were able to keep broken files you would have 900mb's of useless files. If you were able to keep broken files you would still be able to keep what you were able to download.

have to press enter. It would be good imo to use the

), now i have to press backspace, and imo the left 
arrow would be better. Thank you in advance and keep up the good work!</detail>

Now if I try to do that it says to me that 'I have to select  
only one file'. This feature would permit to create an archive as in the  
following example: 
I have three files on the file system: one.txt, two.txt,  
three.txt. 
I select all of them in the 7-zip file manager. 
I right click and select the new feature, or the 'split file'  
enhanced. 
I obtain a set of compressed files of fixed sizes,  
containing all the files I've selected (one.txt, two.txt,  
three.txt).</detail>

        <detail> Well, for now 7zip's sources are completely unportable to  
other platforms... afx used all around... it didn't even  
want to compile on my windows box. 
I'ld like to port 7zip to AmigaOS and Linux but cleaning up  
the sources would be necessary before.

2- an option (plug-in or right on the create archive window as well) to create recovery file data for an archive such as a par2 file. request #1 seems much more simple and important.  #2 would be nice but i suppose not as critical for as many users. thanks.</detail>

Compression could by option automatically resume upon restart of the machine or upon low cpu load.</detail>

I'd say 99% of the 001+ files I have are actually RARs. 
No matter what I do (aside from renaming the files), 
7-Zip won't extract it properly.  I have to open WinRAR 
then navigate to the folder and extract the 001 from 
there (WinRAR won't even see the 001 files correctly).

Obviously these options are not relevant to all files, the only option that should be there for all files is &quot;Add to archive&quot;. The same goes for the context menu one gets when dragging and dropping a file, &quot;Extract here&quot; has no meaning for a .avi or .jpg file, so it should not be there. I suggest that these context menus should only be applicable to the files associated with 7-Zip in under the &quot;Options &gt; System&quot; menu.</detail>

Whenever I download .tar.gz files from somewhere, 7-zip -can- unpack them, though only by unpacking the .tar.gz to just .tar, and then to files. This seems to me an unnecessary complication, wouldn't it be better just to have .tar.gz -&gt; files instead of going via the .tar? In other words, why have two steps to perform one action when the same action can be performed through one step?</detail>

        <title>#1060 Compress ASCII files with text file property, not binary</title>
        <detail> We are using Pkware PZKIP 12.X application in our z/os Host. We have realized that when we unzip ascii text files zipped by 7-Zip, the internal property of this zip file is marked as &quot;Binary&quot; [Bytes 37-38: 00 00], so Pkzip unzip the file in binary mode and the unzipped file is an ASCII file, not an EBCDIC file, the format of text files in IBM host mainframes. So our JCLs doesnt understand files, and the results are errors. Is it possible to mark ascii text files zipped by 7-zip (only text files, and not binary or hibryd binary and text files) in the internal properties as ¡°text¡± [Bytes 37-38: 01 00]?.

        <title>#1058 Automatic crash reporting</title>
        <detail> To make 7-Zip more stable it is very helpful to automatically generate and send crash reports. 
Generating crash report manually and manually submitting it into bug tracker is very complicated procedure for most of the users. And even these how can make it prefer to not waste their time. 
Automatic submission (by one click or no clicks at all) raises crash reports flow in thousands times. 
That big flow can drive developer's efforts to a right direction when these bugs fixed first that affects most users and not one that has a time to submit it in a bug tracker. There is a statistics that 1 percent of top crash bugs fixes 50% of all crashes: In recent months, Microsoft has learned that 80 percent of the errors and crashes in Windows and Office are caused by 20 percent of the entire pool of bugs detected, and that more than 50 percent of the headaches derive from a mere 1 percent of all flawed code. 
 I represent   a crash reporting and analyzing service. 
I would like to suggest adding to 7-Zip of crash report sending feature for free. In very short it looks like this: 7-Zip crashes, the user is offered to send the crash report to the manufacturer. The report is uploaded, system analyzes it and then group it with similar problems. Further developers can download the interesting memory dump, open it in a debugger and try to find and fix a bug. 
Key feature is that all of that does automatically in ¡°one click¡±. Experience shows that almost no users send a crash report if this require any difficult actions (sending an e-mail or registering in bug tracker is difficult enough). One click is so easy way that some users do it (many users do not do even this). 
Other key feature is that all preprocessing of crash reports is done for you. You have no need to open each report and see that you already has fixed it. The small description and demonstration are accessible here: 
 Also you can open a demo project and browse a little:

        <title>#223 single archive for each file</title>
        <detail> The major thing that I am looking foward to in 7z is the  
option to compress multiple files into seperate archives  
so that &quot;file1.ext&quot; becomes &quot;file1.7z&quot; and &quot;file2.ext&quot;  
becomes &quot;file2.7z&quot; etc. Also an option for files with the  
same name, when compressing into seperate archives,  
to determine if the would use the same 7z (so &quot;file.ext&quot;  
and &quot;file.ex2&quot; become &quot;file.7z&quot;) or to split them so  
that &quot;file.ext&quot; becomes &quot;file.ext.7z&quot; and &quot;file.ex2&quot;  
becomes &quot;file.ex2.7z&quot; but &quot;file2.ext&quot; becomes &quot;file2.7z&quot;,  
or the third alternative which is to always use the  
extension for each archive name. A checkbox and a  
small dropdown selection box, perhaps on a &quot;tab&quot; that is  
not the main option area would be sufficient ui, although  
you might not want these options to save like other  
ones as it might not always be the desired operation  
and it would be quick to set, seeing as how it would be  
always dealing with many files for this kind of behavior. Thank you for your consideration, and keep up the  
improvement. I'd love to see 7z as the dominent  
compressor.</detail>

attribute (this attribute in windows indicates that the

With This options it would be easy make a complete

        <title>#880 Automatically execute/run a file, when there is only 1 file</title>
        <detail> Hi- 
I deal with a lot of zipped files, where 99% of them contain only one file inside them (A word document). 
Is there currently a way to be able to run the zipped file, without going through the intermediate step of opening the 7z GUI? 
If not, would you be able to add such a feature? 
Basically, it is as if you open the zip file in the GUI, then double click on the only file in there to launch microsoft word. 
Options would be:  
- Execute if there is less than N files (N=1 is a good start). 
- Execute only certain file types  (doc, docx would be a good start). 
Of course, this feature would be silent if there are more than N files, or if the file is of a different type. The GUI would open then. Let me know if this is already possible.

        <detail> 7-zip has so far been an incredible replacement 
for winRAR in my case. One thing I miss though : 
When double-clicking an executable inside an 
archive, winrar would extract all files to the 
temp folder, so you can run your program. 7-zip 
will just extract the executable, and very often 
it won't work since it needs the other files. Also, the option to &quot;remove files when done&quot; when 
compressing would also be nice. Those two small things are the only &quot;problems&quot; I 
could find with 7-zip !! Thanks for this incredible piece of software. CSB</detail>

Thanks in advance.  [Mainly I like consistency, but maybe there was some idea in the past that this change was better or easier somehow. 
I can understand the desire to make things simpler for translators but since this is a very simple button that is nearly as widely used as OK or Cancel, I do think it would be fairly easy for translators and something they would very likely already know how to do without too much trouble. 
I can understand you might think a smaller button looks better but a slightly bigger button with a label is a fraction of a second easier to recognise and marginally easier to hit. 
Also the label should probably be &quot;_Browse...&quot; with a keyboard accelerator under the B, keyboard navigation can be very helpful too.]</detail>

When this ceiling is encountered, leave the previously used value in place as the default for the next time. This request applies to LZMA(2) and any other algorithms for which a dictionary larger than the data is simply stupid. (Even if/though 7-zip were/is smart when decompressing and did/does not allocate a larger dictionary than the uncompressed data size, other tools might be simpler and should be given a hand when it's so easy to do so.) (As a matter of principle, I don't think the user should be left *unable* to use a larger dictionary than the uncompressed data, but they should certainly have to go out of their way to do so.)</detail>

perfect, and here it goes: Ctrl+U: swap the two panels. Currently you have Large and small Icon view as well as  
list and detail, Why not add a thumbnail view as well? Your panels show a list of files, can you add a preview  
panel mode that would try to show the content of the  
selected item of the other panel, or if not then try to  
write some additional info about it, like internal structure  
of Exe or Dll files. Saving the prefered view modes and sorting method for  
both panels to be used the next time the program is run. Some preferences do not remain when we enter another  
directory or archive, why not keep the preferrence in a  
panel all the time?</detail>

I've observed that 7z doesn't run on a complete but fresh installation on Win95b. However, some of the many updates brought by Internet Explorer 5.5 sp2 to W95 is enough to allow 7z to run. Since ie552 is recommended anyway on W95, it is a good solution. Could the website, the installer or some readme file (or all three) tell it, to help users of W95? Also, as competitors like IZArc don't run on W95, i'd be happy to get as many archive formats from 7z as possible. Thanks!

        <detail> I would suggest adding this feature to the &amp;quot;Compressing

file size by dividing the current size of the output 
file by the percentage completed.  In the first 10% or 
so the ammount will likely be much higher (a 120Mb file 
could project a 900Mb final archive) than the actual 
archive will be so I recommend putting a cap on the 
display of 10% of the total file size.  You also may 
want to /not/ display the estimate until after the 
first 10% have completed for this reason. Math Example: Variables: Percentage Complete (Compressing XYZ%) 
-------- Current File Size (Temp File) 
-------- Actual File Size (Size of Original) Current File Size / X.YZ = Estimated File Size where Estimated File Size &amp;lt;= Actual File Size * 1.10

        <title>#258 Smart single-folder archive extraction</title>
        <detail> A lot of archives contain a single folder with all its 
contents within. For instance, OpenOffice.org for 
Windows has binary archives named 
OOo_x.x.x_Win32Intel_install.zip that each contain a 
single folder named OOo_x.x.x_Win32Intel_install, which 
matches the archive filename. 7-Zip has a command to extract the archive to a folder 
of the same name, but if it extracts the above example 
file with this method, the user will end up with the 
unnecessarily two-level folder structure 
OOo_x.x.x_Win32Intel_install\OOo_x.x.x_Win32Intel_install\, 
the bottom-most level of course containing the files. Instead, in situations like the above, when the 
&quot;Extract to OOo_x.x.x_Win32Intel_install\&quot; command is 
selected, 7-Zip should just extract the contents of the 
single compressed folder to 
OOo_x.x.x_Win32Intel_install\, which would end up being 
the same as selecting &quot;Extract here,&quot; except the user 
doesn't have to open the archive and have the optional 
intuition to decide which command is best.</detail>

Would you be so kind and add support for WinZIP archives spilt into separate files? Example: 
first .... {name}.z01 
second ... {name}.z02 
... 
last ..... {name}.zip Thanks in advance and very special thanks for this helpful tool. ---

        <title>#630 Explorer-Like Ability to Browse Archive</title>
        <detail> One neat feature of XP's zip feature is that you can, with a bit of fiddling, display the zip archive in the left hand explorer pane and expand in a tree view, with files in each sub-dir displayed in the right hand pane. It would be great if windows would do this with .7z files, but maybe the 7z browser window could mimic such behaviour.</detail>

        <title>#1033 Emulate solid archiving for ZIP files</title>
        <detail> Even though ZIP files does not support solid archiving, this can be emulated as in .tar.gz archives, i.e. 
1. add all the files to a ZIP archive with no compression (STORE) 
2. add the above resulting archive to a ZIP archive with compression (optionally add some kind of solid-flag to tell the decompressor that this is a solid archive) 
Note that this approach is mostly backward compatible because existing decompressors will be able to extract the files just fine (obviously they will need to extract the uncompressed archive first, and then extracting the files from it). OTOH if the zip decompressor is solid-flag-aware it could choose to do the double decompression on the fly.</detail>

        <title>#687 7-Zip FM doesn't remember Password of opened archives</title>
        <detail> It would be be a nice feature for 7-Zip File Manager to remember the password of an archive while it is opened! Background: When a password-protected 7z-archive is opened in 7-Zip File Manager and you then want to open one of the files inside the archive you have to enter the password again. This is espacially annoying if you have to open serveral different files in an archive an don't want to extract it completely. Also see

        <title>#472 improve opening of encrypted files</title>
        <detail> When opening encrypted zip files by double click: 1. if you open more files one by one 7-zip should ask 
for the password only once, just for the first file. 2. The &quot;elapsed time&quot; should not count the time when 
the user is being asked for a password (requester is 
displayed). The elapsed time in the current form 
doesn't make any sense. 3. When no password or wrong password is given and the 
file is not extracted 7-zip should not call the 
associated windows program to open the file. Now it 
calls windows giving a filename of a file which doesn't 
exist (this seems to me like a BUG). Regards,</detail>

the desired location?  If there is a good reason for 
making this temp extraction, why not have a setting 
that would allow those of us who don't care to turn it off? Alternatively, why not request that Windows *move* the 
temporary extraction folder to the new location, this 
would be alot faster than copying.</detail>

i have a feature suggestment for installer Because 7-zip takes not too much place in installer, 
maybe it's better for you to reduce support efforts to 
publish 7z64 and 7z32 binaries in single install packet and 
during installation to define in automatic mode what version x32  
or x64 of binaries to use pluses of this feature i see 
- this will allow you to decrease your efforts on releasing versions for different installers 
- this will allow to guys that use 7-zip as a part of their software to include installer of 7-zip 
and to be sure that the most suit version will be used automatically 
- this will allow to users just don't think what  
architecture they have when downloading 7-zip because you thought  
about their convinience and reduced size of installer minuses 
- increased size of installer 
- issue when somebody with IA64 installed 7-zip and copied it to  
flash device to use it as portable application in internet caffee

The addition of an option equal to the maximum file size storable on a FAT 32 volume (4Gb - 1 byte or 4294967295 bytes) would be very handy for some. I realise any value can be entered manually but having to look this number up each time (or remember it, or calculate it :) is a pain.  With the current prevalence of FAT 32 formatted USB drives I'm sure this option would be used more often that some of the other defaults (3.5&quot; floppy? For real?).</detail>

        <title>#1025 &quot;Lax&quot; archive parsing</title>
        <detail> I have encountered numerous files over time, mostly ZIPs, that cannot be extracted by 7-Zip, giving either an error or a corrupted file. Those same ZIP files work fine in say, WinRAR, or WinZIP.  I know this is because 7-Zip doesn't tolerate corrupt file data, however sometimes there is no way to get a new ZIP (the corrupted one is all that is available).  Rather than having to keep a copy of WinRAR for those occasions, how feasible would it be to implement a &quot;lax&quot; archive parser, that could be enabled via a checkbox, or as a fallback option should the primary parser fail. There are many small errors in a ZIP file that should not be fatal (such as disk numbering not starting at zero).  This would eliminate many users' need for a second ZIP solution, and allow them to move entirely to 7-Zip.</detail>

but without any popups (simply unzip directly into

difficult that may be to implement, as it is outside  
of your program. Clicking &amp;quot;Cancel&amp;quot; doesn't need to  
produce an &amp;quot;Operation aborted&amp;quot; message. Overall  
this is a great program. What other compression

        <title>#1011 Split to feature</title>
        <detail> Hi Igor. First of all i want to say thank you for your tool, i use it home and work, in backup utility, a special very big thanks for performance! Youre the best. I wanted to point out a scenario of splitting big files.  
Usually i perform splitting when want to write someting to flashes or cd-rws. But when splitting directly to flash there're two problems. First flash has not exactly the same space as second, the other point - that i need to presave to temp folder splitted files and then copy to flash So it will be great if there was an option to split by available size of device. And when device is full, to close files and dirs, so flash can be safely removed and other flash inserted, open a popup with prompt to insert that space is finished where to save other data with textbox with path, As for me its not often scenario. 
And i wanted to thank you again for great performance! I'm mad on your archiver!</detail>

        <title>#1008 on archiving absolute paths,  ./ and ../</title>
        <detail> When 7z archives path, rule seems to be 
- if path starts with n: or / or it contains . or .., drop whole path Consider changing it to 
- if path starts with n: or / or it contains . or .., drop this element and everything on the left So 
- /foo/bar would be archived as foo/bar, not bar 
- foo/./bar/baz would be archived as bar/baz, not baz This would let user 
- select what parts of path to keep, what parts to drop (by inserting ./) 
- pack complex projects scattered on multiple disks For me, it is important functionality available in rar, missing in 7zip, there is no efficient workaround. Is there any technical problem with it? Where should I look in source code?</detail>

        <detail> I'd like to see the ability to plan a compression &quot;project.&quot; By way of example: when burning a CD using any modern program, you can create a new drag and drop files into an explorer-type window, reorganize/rename/do whatever else with them, THEN press the &quot;burn&quot; button to actually move all of those files onto the CD. My suggestion would work the same way. The program would allow you to specify which folders/files will be added and from where, what their new names/folder arrangements will be, and so forth -- then once you're ready, you just press the &quot;compress&quot; button and it puts it together for you.  Additionally handy would be the ability to save a &quot;project&quot; for repeated use, I'm sure some people would find it useful.</detail>

        <detail> Hi, first of all THANK YOU for such a GOOD THING !!! my idea is to add a general wrapper for any program that  
creates archives (i read about unace.dll) and support  
command line options. There may be the opportunity to  
create such modules by simply placing a text-configuration  
file somewhere in the program path containing all possible  
options to that archiver. like: ---configuration file 
name=MyOne 
execute_cmd=&quot;c:\programs\foo1.0\foo.bat&quot; 
compression_levels=none,fast,maximum,testalg 
compression_cmd_none= 
compression_cmd_fast= 
compression_cmd_testalg= compression_methods=lzma,mega 
compression_cmd_lzma= 
compression_cmd_mega= 
split_options=1440:floppy,700000:CD 
split_cmd_floppy= 
split_cmd_CD= 
encryption_option=1 
encryption_cmd= 
solid_option=0 
solid_cmd= 
sfx_option=0 
sfx_cmd= 
---end the program will be called then with all command line options,  
the archive filename and then all file to be compressed i think this would add support even for proprietary programs  
that support command line options. just an idea ...</detail>

        <detail> English: 
I am currently developing a program that uses external console programs like 7za.exe to perform the archivating or copying. Program connectiong to the console output and took out the current precent rate of progress of the operation.  
Working with Rar.exe console output is correct and the results as a percentage periodically returned to the console output, but output in 7za.exe comes only after completion of all operations of the process. First: need a switch to show the performance of the overall operation of all the files and not only for each separately.  
Second: needed a switch to enable output in the console using StdOut to be able to read the current results and not just the result of the completion of the operation. Russian:

        <title>#910 7ZFM: multiple compression profiles for each archive format</title>
        <detail> Although 7-Zip File Manager already stores compression settings for each archive type, it only stores 1 setting, which is inadequate for archives formats that support multiple compression methods, and it isn't just .7z archive.  For example, the BZip2 and PPMd compress text files better than binary files, while LZMA and LZMA2 compress binary files better than text files.  Compression sizes aside, methods such as PPMd use large amount of memory during decompression, which can cause archives to become unusable in embedded environments unless the parameters are re-tuned. The ability to store multiple command line settings per archive type will save user the hassle of retyping the command lines over and over, and improve usability for installer package building.</detail>

        <title>#361 Urgent need : a full archive view &quot;Winzip style&quot; (or ls -lR)</title>
        <detail> Please, I really think that the only lack of 7-Zip is a view 
giving a full linsting of all the archive content, in a 
similar manner to the Winzip view, which will remain a 
comparative element for a lot of people for still a 
long time. Having several views is great and preferable, 
especially if these are selectable with preferences.  But not having a full list view prevent the users to 
have comparison with the most traditionally used archivers. And it also prevents to have the one-glimpse view of 
the full content of the archive, which is precisely a 
need for archive files. Thank's by advance, for this new tip which will be a 
progress for the users and for 7-zip itself. Micla.</detail>

        <title>#637 Sort order of files for creation should be optional</title>
        <detail> I understand 7-ZIP sorts files, primarily by extension, and then by basename (or something like that) to aid 'solid' compression I suppose. This sorting should be able to be disabled for reasons set out below of corrupt/partial archives, and because sometimes the user knows better than 7-zip!!! I would like to see the option of DISABLING the sort order, instead using the canonical file-system order.  Reason:  
We make big archives (hundreds of Megabytes) from thousands of folder.  The sort order makes a real mess of things if we get a corruption in an archive or a partial archive - This can happen fairly regularly when we are shipping such big archives.  
Often, to us, a partial archive is OK for our purposes.  But the 7-ZIP sort order means that if we lose a bit of the archive it 'damages' many of our thousands of sub-folders. It 'spreads out' the damage over many sub-folders. It would be better the damage be localised to the minimum number of folders for the 'lost part' of the archive. 
(When we get partial sub-folders they essentially become unusable to us.) Further, the files in these sub-folders ARE likely to be similar to each other. - NOT compressing them together could result in WORSE compression. 7-ZIP should not assume it is smarter than it's users...  Anyway, I strongly support that there SHOULD be an option to turn off the sorting of files as they go into the archive... </detail>

WinRAR installed. - ACE Extraction, some files are in .ace format and  
it's necessary. - ISO support. - MSI Installer with silent mode, to install it in  
all my network from one point. All this features are necessary for only use 7-zip in  
all my network, and don't need other compression  
software.</detail>

        <title>#94 Strange control</title>
        <detail> 7zip is very good program, thanks for it. But it has control different from another file managers, 
what is a little non-comfort. Classic veterans like NC, WC, MC has F8 to delete file. 
They lists &amp;quot;two dots&amp;quot; for parent directory also. Using old fashion is quicker and more intuitive. Could you change it or make optional, please? Thank you Petr</detail>

        <title>#758 Option: Don't use TEMP folder</title>
        <detail> It's immensely annoying when trying to extract a few hundred MB's to another drive - 7Zip's default operation mimics the other idiotic applications out there by extracting to a temp folder and then moving the files from there when done. So if you close the destination window before the whole operation is finished, you get a final error message that 7Zip doesn't know where to move the timeously extracted files to.  Computers are supposed to make things quicker and simpler, and by adding a simple feature like &quot;Direct file operations&quot; or &quot;Don't use temp files/directories&quot; 7Zip will fit into the &quot;Better and Simpler&quot; computing model much better.</detail>

An improvement fo the 7zip installation...

I know, my fault. However 7zip tells me &quot;CRC error&quot; instead of &quot;volume missing&quot; or something like that. Even better would be an option to tell 7zip which volume is next.

In my opinion, the best way is to implement the new  
feature is to extend to the state-action functionality  
abount the -u switch to the extract commands (e,x). STATE: 
x = File in archive is newer than the file on disk  
q = File exists in archive, but doesn't exist on disk.  
p = ..... ACTION: 
0 = Ignore file (don't create item in the destination  
directory for this file) 
1 = extract file (extract from the archive to the  
destination directory ) 
2....  Please add this feature. Thank you for your fantastic

It really annoys me when I extract a 7z archive and the &quot;Date Created&quot; line becomes the current date and time. :(  Meanwhile, if I create a RAR file in WinRAR, I can store the &quot;Date Created&quot; and then later extract the file again and it keeps that date. Please, implement this in the near future if possible.  I know I'm not the only person who would appreciate this. :)</detail>

        <title>#393 Speed improvment</title>
        <detail> 7-Zip works great for me and looks extremnly stable, 
even when I try to compress directories with around 
40Gbytes. 
The only &quot;but&quot; is that in some &quot;old&quot; PIII-0.5Ghz the 
process can take around one and a half days to complete 
(for the mentioned 40Gbytes when I use a command like  
7z a -r last_totalBackup00.7z dataDir\*). 
It's quite normal to use old machines to make backups 
so I think the problem will apply to many people. 
I know it's not easy or maybe imposible to make those 
speed improvements but anyway I think it's worth to 
mention it for considaration.</detail>

compression is (and the lovely style of displaying

self-extracting exes to take advantage the hign level 
of compression. I know the preference would be for those people to get 
7-Zip and install it but some of the non-technical 
people I know haven't got sufficient priveledges for that. Vin</detail>

        <title>#702 Faster through multiple file requests</title>
        <detail> Happy new year! When archiving many small files, 7z (like so many programs) gets less fast due to the hard disk's access time to each file. However, modern disks (S-Ata 2, some P-Ata as well, and most Scsi) allow to optimize this access time by reorganizing the accesses out-of-order (called NCQ by S-Ata 2). Very efficient, provided that the program issues many file requests in a queue without waiting each one to be completed. Could 7z implement it ? This needs to use ReadFile() with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED. I believe it works on Win Nt4, 2k, Xp, 2k3 and their successors, but not on W95-98-98se-Me. The attached file contains an explanation. Thanks!

        <detail> Problem: If AES-256 is selected instead of ZipCrypto, or one of the wrong compression methods is selected, WinZip cannot decrypt and uncompress the .ZIP file that 7-Zip writes. Suggestion: (1)Every time .ZIP format is selected, Force all the other settings to go a default, known-best-compatible parameter set so it's idiot proof. Or,  
(2) add a click box that would force this. Or 
(3) minimally, just put add an indicator - like ZD (for ZIP-DEFAULT) to the appropriate line in the section list so its easy to know and pick the most compatible settings Why its important: The only reason to write a .ZIP instead of a .7z file, is to make it compatible with WinZip, Stuffit, and all other ZIP applications. It is a huge frustration that makes people junk 7-zip when it writes a .zip file that other people cant read. THANKS!!</detail>

        <title>#404 Incremental backup functionality</title>
        <detail> I propose an added feature that might require an 
extension to the 7z file format: Say I've got 2-3 GB worth of compressed files to back 
up, and I'd like to record these files' contents for 
each day, without reproducing the whole archive each time. Ok, so first, create the initial archive, on 2005-10-06. 
The next day, 2005-10-07, use a -u switch like the one 
in your help file: 
&gt;7z u c:\1\exist.7z -u- -up0q3x2z0!c:\1\update.7z * -r 
But imagine, if you will, a different update switch 
where the new file information would be appended to the 
original archive, so you have one file that contains 
both the original backup and the updated information.  
Then, on top of that you could run an additional backup 
on 2005-10-08, and further append the difference to the 
original archive. Ultimately, you have a file that contains multiple 
versions of files that are updated frequently, but only 
one copy of those files that have remained the same.</detail>

you have some recovery data that is well defined. I don't know how the algo is defined. Sample: this is an array of binary datas 
a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 
b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 
c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 
d1 d2 d3 d4 d5  
e1 e2 e3 e4 e5  ISO will store the data like 
a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 (a1+a2+a3+a4+a5) 
b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 (b1+b2+b3+b4+b5) 
c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 (c1+c2+c3+c4+c5) 
d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 (d1+d2+d3+d4+d5) 
e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 (e1+e2+e3+e4+e5) 
s1 s2  s3 s4 s5 s6  
Where s[x] = a[x]+b[x]+c[x]+d[x]+e[x] So instead of storing 25 bytes... we store 36 bytes. 
But we are able to recover 1 error. 
(I think the CDRom algo is more evolued) It would be cool if in the algorythm used to 
compress+decompress we remove and regenerate this 
missing information. --------------------------------------------------- another important point. 
Imagine you want to store: 
&quot;hello, hello and hello, hellohellohello&quot; A way to store it is to say (The algo in 7Zip is more 
efficent I hope :-) ) 
&quot;5hello@1, @1 and @1, @1@1@1&quot; When you store using some recovery method 
&quot;hel[h+e+l]lo, [o+,+ ]hel[h+e+l]lo [... 
Here we cannot find the word &quot;hello&quot;... --------------------------------------------------- So the algo compress become 
if (look like an iso) { 
remove_iso_checksum; 
} 
compress_like_before() So the algo decompress 
decompress_like_before() 
if (look like an iso) { 
add_iso_checksum; 
} Gab</detail>

        <title>#906 Reed-Solomon recovery records</title>
        <detail> I think it would be a good functionality to add to compete with WinRAR. It's one of the main feature I miss currently in 7zip.  
Since 7zip version 9 is making some incompatible changes to the file format (like new compression LZMA2) it seems like a perfect time to define a file format extension for parity data as well, before the new version goes out of beta.  Then there could a command line option to add N% size after compression for parity/recovery info where N is configurable by percentage. If you wanted to, you could use an open-source library for Reed-Solomon coding (such as  ) to save on implementation time.</detail>

MMX, SSE, and SSE2 instructions set if available. This  
probably will improve the speed of 7-Zip about 10%-20%.</detail>

        <title>#829 Avoid reloading the directory tree.</title>
        <detail> We use *.tar.gz as a backup mechanism. Dumps are 16 G + and with 7z we can open them in two steps. It works quite good, although it takes 17 minutes to open the dump file. After the second step (opening the tar), you will see the directory sturcture contained, in our case: home 
opt 
var Then you can navigate the contents of the archive and go up by pressing 'Backspace'. If you press backspace by coincidence once too much when going up, you have to open the archive again. This takes again 17 minutes. Suggested change: if pressing backspace takes you out of the inner archive, please show something like 'You are about to exit this archive. Do you want to exit this archive and go to the containing archive?' with Yes/No.</detail>

        <title>#1095 7-zip should use parallel decompress to avoid bad behavior</title>
        <detail> 7-zip runs abysmally slow on modern machines doing decompression, when it could easily run 4-6 x faster on most machines and 8-12 times faster on many. As it isn't even close to being I/O bound (writing decompressed files at 13MB/s on disks capable of over 50 times that speed), this would be like detroit building a car for a moddern highway that can only do 3 MPH... Most people would consider than unacceptable performance -- even a bug, but some will response that is performance according to it's designed specification -- and by that definition, it isn't a bug.  But from a performance standpoint -- I don't think it would pass modern QA standards I was getting 10MB / s 10 years  
ago with gzip!... and that was on compression....here we are talking uncompression which is supposed to be faster... I guess I don't get why decompression is so slow...? Anyway, as 'implied', it seemed you wanted this added as a feature request as running with a 86-93% performance penalty isn't considered a bug. Ok. I don't care... just as long as it gets addressed at some point -- but obviously, if it was important enough for me -- I'd do it myself and send you the patch or release it or something...;-) I have a reasonably fast machine. 3.33GHz (6 core Xeon), yet on decompressing a file 
7-zip achieves an astounding rate of 15MB/s... fully broken. The disk is a RAID0 of SSD's easily capable of well over 100MB/s (200-400 is more typical). Even a single HD can usually write over 100MB/s. So using parallel decompression 
on a 6-core processor would, for most people not saturate their HD. With increasingly 
common RAID and SSD setups, it wouldn't even touch 1/3-1/4 the bandwidth (if I did it on 
my server -- - it's got a 1GB/s write rate... so 15MB/s when unpacking a 4GB archive 
is unreasonably slow given current I/O speeds and parallel options... This would ***presume*** the archive was not packed as 1 continuous block, 
but used, say, block sizes of that made parallelism, possible -- something I've learned 
to do since I found (surprisingly) that a larger block size isn't always smaller. By default I used a 1G BS (64MBdic, 128bit word)... I found this was quite a bit less than optimal.. 
(I'm running a program that often needs to access / extract parts of a .7z archive to repair damage 
created when one switches around load load orders (game=oblivion). I figured a smaller block size 
would make so it didn't have to unpack as many blocks to access the files it needed (vs. if it is a 1GB 
or solid blocksize, it would need to compress linearly from the beginning as I understand it. So I ran several tests and better than my previous defaults were several smaller block sizes with the best 
being 'a solid archive at max word size and 1GB dictionary.' Chart: 
src=346,735,328 (338601K, 338668K alloc) 
test compressions 
BS(MB) dic(MB) Word size(K) (Overhead) 
1024 64 128 270796 1.77% larger 
64 32 64 269708 1.36% larger 
64 32 32 269696 1.36% larger 
64 32 24 269696 1.36% larger 
64 32 16 269692 1.36% larger 
64 48 32 269528 1.30% larger 
64 48 24 269528 1.30% larger 
64 48 16 269520 1.29% larger 
64 64 32 269468 1.27% larger 
64 64 24 269468 1.27% larger 
64 64 16 268462 0.89% larger 
64 64 16 268462 0.89% larger 
solid 1024 273 266082 0.00% larger ---- 
Of course this would vary depending on the data compressed, but a 64MB MB 
block size with 64MB dict and 16bit word gave results darn close to optimal. So... For these files I'm using a 64MB block size. My test file above was 5. x 64MB, meaning it likely could have been 
decompressed in parallel given enough memory to buffer things. That's something that would have to be taken into account when activating multiple decompression 
threads unless the final uncompressed size of each block is known in advance. Regardless the entire file's post-allocated size *should* be pre-allocated (NOTE -- 
this should be done in even a non-parallel compress so the OS allocates 1 large 
chunk to hold the whole file). Another risk if you write small chunks -- some other 
process might ask for allocations in the middle of your file. In any event, you can see that in even my small test file -- 6 threads would help, 
and on my server, with the 1GB/s RAID and 12 threads, parallelism would kick butt! ;-) Thanks,

        <detail> Hi! I wanna ask a feature that is very useful for backups. 
If 7z can support special chars in output filename, and parse, and replace them to any predefined values, it will be easier to make backups. For example: 
*yy* 
*mm* 
*DD* Then I can make a simple timestamped backup with 7z, without installing, setting up a special outer tool. 7z -a c:\* d:\cbackup_*yymmdd_HHMMSS*.7z Thanks for your help:

is &amp;quot;Add to Archive ...&amp;quot;. I would find it very comfortable if  
I also had the option to to choose &amp;quot;Add to Archive:  
[name]&amp;quot;, where name should be the name of the current  
folder with the file extension of the most recently used  
Archive Format (just like the GUI does it). It's an option  
that WinZip does have, and I kind of got used to it. Thanks in advance! Robert Keurentjes</detail>

        <detail> Archiving large folders some files are displayed to exceed 100% of the original file-size (e.g. 7z, .zip, .mpx, .cab, .exe), if the selected compression settings do not allow further compression. Is this correct or is this a display error? I find that nearly all files can be compressed, when I vary between  the various methods available in 7z like LZMA(2), Deflate(64), BZIP, but then I have created many separate files.  Since for backups size and not so much time matters, could 7zip be modified to  
- test each file for achievable file size using e.g LZMA(2), Deflate(64), BZIP and create a result log file  
- allow to create archives that assign a optimized compression method to each file using the log-file  
- update/edit the log-file to add/delete/modify if frequent backups are made from the same folders. While this may offset efficiency if only small files exist, but it would increase compression ratio for backups in average. Tnx for considering my proposal</detail>

        <detail> Like WinRAR 7z should use predefined files list for 
solid archiving, in most cases it gives superior ratio 
for the resulting file. Also having file_id.diz, *.txt, 
etc. at the beginning of archive really helps sometimes. Attached my RarFiles.lst that has gone through years of 
tweaking on Win32 platform, for it to be more useful on 
Linux and others it needs some more work.</detail>

        <detail> It would be really great to add ability to create installations/setups with some build-in script language. Script language should include some basic tasks like: 
- adding/removing values in windows registry 
- adding/removing files 
- adding custom dialog boxes (that would be great) 
and so on. as 7-Zip has greatest compression ration, i guess it need to grow up in some installation/setup creating package. p.s.: may this all features needs to be implemented as new project (not as 7-Zip's features).</detail>

It seems silly to me that multiple archives can be created by 7-Zip but it has to be done with command prompt. I am sure there are many people out there like me who just aren't able, or prepared, to do that. Why bother having the program be able to do it but not include it in the GUI??? I have been using 7-Zip for years and now that I have a need to create thousands of archives from files I have to use another program (Peazip) just for that. Please please please get this sorted.</detail>

I`d like to ask for two features: 
1) Delete to Recycle Bin -- this option I wish can be in  
Preferances, so to enable/disable deleting to Recycle  
Bin or completly delete. Now 7-zip only delete completly  
which is very uncomfortabel really. 
2) OpenOffice files (*.sxw) are treated like archeves. But  
mostly people don`t need to go inside it. So now if you  
press Enter on such file you don`t run OpenOffice but go  
inside of it and to open it you need to go to contextual  
menu&gt;System&gt;open. So I suggest to make some  
prevention agains such behavier (Enter must lanch OOO  
and open file in it).</detail>

        <title>#802 improved effectiveness</title>
        <detail> Dear Igor Pavlov, dear developers, Beside that your packer is a real great piece of software(!!!), I want to point to an amazing difference in efficency under some circumstances between the &quot;standard&quot; 7Z.exes, compared to the 7-Zip TotalCommander plugin &quot;7zip.wcx&quot; (tested with several versions .0.5x). MY RESULTS WERE 
1 differences are NOT really depending on setting of number of &quot;fast bytes&quot; 
2 but very much depending on number of identical data in the package! 
3 Prepacked data is better compressed by the Plugin, too. 
(allways assuming having and using enough RAM...) EXAMPLE FILE SET 
A very good (but no exclusive) example is &quot;ar9lite_deu.exe&quot; (Acrobat Reader lite, GERMAN package): 
Download:  _deu.exe 
THE RESULT IS ALMOST 10% BETTER WITH THE .WCX-PLUGIN than with 7z 4.xx!  
You can easily reproduce this by yourself.  If the reason for this can easily be found out and if its not too hard to implement new switches/functions, I would suggest switches like: 
-ap   :  assume (much) prepacked Data 
-ar   :  assume (much) redundant Data PS:  Another, even older idea of mine is to implement a mode which produces a variety of 
possible approaches to get best packing results; the name of the output file could, for 
example, reflect the used switches, added as part of the name of the output file. With kind regards

that 7-zip used 80MB of memory compressing a

        <detail> When archiving directories that are under source control, I often want to exclude the source control directories before sending the source to someone. At the moment I have two methods to do this 
1) Copy the directory somewhere else and use Windows Explorer to find the CVS or SVN directories, delete everything that comes up in the search results, compress the folder with 7zip then delete the copied directory. 
2) Use the command line to exclude files like Entries, Entries.Old, CVS, SVN etc Since it can be done via the command line, would it not be possible to have an option in the GUI that says &quot;Exclude Hidden Files&quot; or &quot;Exclude source control directories&quot; or something?</detail>

        <title>#176 Default associations</title>
        <detail> Sorry about my duplicate post of the previous RFE. As a former WinZip user, it took me quite a while to find  
the &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; option to automatically associate ZIP and  
other extensions to 7-ZIP file manager. Therefore I  
would suggest to do either of the following: [a] automatically associate .7Z and .ZIP to the program  
during the installation [b] after installation, automatically launch the File  
Manager and open the Options window (with .7Z  
and .ZIP flagged by default, preferrably) [c] if you cannot do it after installation, maybe you  
could open the Options window whenever File Manager is  
first launched. The disadvantage of option [c] is that a stupid user like  
myself, wouldn't even think about launching the File  
Manager by himself, because we WinZip users just don't  
expect to have to do this (and frankly, I rather didn't  
open the WinZip GUI anyway). I realise that it's just a stupid thing, but it's usually this  
type of thing that make a program easy and intuitive to  
work with. It's the difference between having to read all  
the options in the right click menu  (and find &amp;quot;Open  
Archive&amp;quot; in it) or just double clicking, like most of us love  
to do... Thanks for hearing me out! Regards,

        <detail> Adding the ability to quickly compress a file or folder to a zip file with a built in date of today would be a great and simple productivity tool. The context menu would be something like &quot;Compress to _.7z&quot; where  would evaluate to something that sorts well like YYYY-MM-DD.     e.g.  &quot;WebApplication1_2010-08-19.7z&quot; This would make it fun to quickly make a backup before you start messing with some files.

        <detail> Right now using shell extension &quot;right click&quot; &quot;add to xxxx.7z&quot; will always use LZMA at &quot;normal&quot; level. In many cases, I would like to use LZMA2 for its better compress speed with multi-core CPU. To use LZMA2, I have to use &quot;Add to archive&quot; and then navigate through all the options. But if I change the compression level, it will reset the compression method back to LZMA. It would be a lot easier for user if there is an option to set the default compression method and level  for &quot;right click, add to xxxxx,7z&quot;.</detail>

 It's one of the few little details that separates 7-zip from perfection (imho).

        <title>#999 extraction log for 7za.exe and 7zsd.sfx</title>
        <detail> Actually extraction log for 7za.exe console tool and 7zsd.sfx module would be great, useful and powerful feature. 
I'm founder and developer of USETOOLS project about absolute alternative advantages with usage of free and open source software running on x86 hardware. It is non-commercial project. We created script-based installation enviroment based on modified sfx module and command line versions of 7-zip for cooking fast and clean high-compressed installers. They were tested a lot during long period of time about several years on plenty of hardware configurations. So we decided to use that methode as the best one for packages installation and rejected nsis, msi, etc. It was not so easy but we implemented all missing functions via cmd but it take too much time for support of such packages... Now i'm reconstructing all basic project enviroment on the go and packaging system is one of fundamental ones for the project. Thus EXTRACTION LOG COULD BE ONE THE BEST FEATURES. 
The log file format should be plain (maybe as one of possible variants controlled via cmd line parameters) i.e. 
package.log: 
DIR0 
DIR0\file1.txt 
DIR0\file1.ini 
DIR0\file1.exe 
DIR1\file1.txt 
readme.txt

Image that I create a archive on a japanese OS with some japanese file names. Then I send it to a man who is using a chinese OS,then he uncompress the archive,what he will get? He will uncompress successfully but all of the file names are not correct. Now I plan to add some context menu by myself and using AppLocale to invoke 7-zip to process the archives which are from another language OS or which I plan to send to a different language OS user. Yes,I think I can solve the promblem now,but I have to study the startup arguments of 7-zip,it's so terrible... I think perhaps we can add a function that user can add a different 7-zip context menu with custmized language which they offen have to use,so that user can proccess the archives with a different language from using OS.</detail>

        <detail> It would be a very useful modification (at least as an option) if previewing of one file would cause extraction of all the other files from the same folder to the temp location. This would be invaluable in many situations, like for example: 
- when previewing an exe file - often an exe may look for additional required files in its directory (like dlls, config files etc.), 
- when previewing an html file - otherwise it's shown without accompanying stylesheet and images, 
- when previewing an image - then the image viewer could be conveniently used to browse through all the pictures. 
This feature could be triggered e.g. by some additional (configurable) key pressed when opening a file.</detail>

        <title>#156 error recovery, drag&amp;amp;drop, better background</title>
        <detail> just wanted to put in a few votes for what I think would  
be most useful to implement on 7-zip. Error recovery is  
probably the most difficult but I would really like to be  
able to recover most of a 7-zip from a scratched cd and  
be able to rebuild the archive like rar supports. Drag and  
drop would be VERY convenient for  
updating/compressing/decompressing archives. The  
background seems to be a foreground process set on a  
timer, it doesn't use all the resources when the  
computer is idle and it doesn't give up all resources  
when the computer is fully engaged (it'd also be cool if  
it went into the system tray like winrar does). Finally, if  
there was any way to speed up renaming within a 7- 
zip/deleting from a 7-zip it would save me time. I think  
this project is great and I now use .7z whenever  
possible. Thanks for a great product!</detail>

        <title>#317 Default compression Format</title>
        <detail> Would it be possible to set an option where specify the  
default format for compression? I mean, if I want to compress my files to .rar format  
instead of 7z, i have to choose the option 'add to file...'  
and then specify the .rar (or any other) format from the  
combo box (i can't use the direct option 'compress  
to &quot;file.7z&quot;)  If i want to work always with .rar files, it would be pretty  
and practical to be possible to fix that setting to the  
default compression format. Thank you very much boys, good job!! </detail>

        <title>#1090 option to prioritize input speed</title>
        <detail> Please consider implementing an option where compression level is dynamic such that the input data is processed as fast as can be read. When the option is used, the bottleneck would not be compression but the input speed. This would be useful for large files containing large amounts of easily compressible data. The goal is for the compression to complete as fast (or close to) as it would be to just reading the input; with the resulting output being smaller if input contained alot of easily compressible data.</detail>

more explorer functionality integrated into 7z manager

an item to the archive 
- right click on an item in 7Zip file manager to pop up  
explorer type of menu item Call me and my friends spoiled if you will, but I hope you  
like the above suggestions to make the product even  
more user friendly and apprecated. I am not sure what syamtnec Ghost use for  
compression, they seem to compress very well  and  
faster then 7z on P4 2.8Mhz   I don't know if it is  
because it is not operating as XP but soem sort of PC  
DOS or they have better compression engine. Or I don't know to make 7z run faster (version 4.2x).</detail>

        <detail> Perhaps I am missing something very obvious but I don't 
see any date option in 7-Zip. 
This is a basic for any compression utility and good 
old PKZIP 2.5 allows you to add files either older or 
newer than a specified date. Example - pkzip logdata  d:\logs\*.*  -t 
takes all files newer than or equal to a date

        <title>#456 File Manager as Explorer Replacement</title>
        <detail> It would be great to use the file manager as an 
Explorer replacement/alternative as well. As many users 
I set Explorer to not showing extensions and hidden 
files for evereyday user's work. However I need a 
second filemanager showing hidden files and extensions 
as well.  7-Zip filemanager is slim and fast, ideal for this 
task, but does not support normal file operation. To 
use it as a (second) fully featured filemanager 
non-compressing file move/copy would be required. Could 
be implemented as a context menue choice. Thanks!</detail>

        <detail> 7-Zip File Manager is an excellent tool, but it's missing  
something that just about every orthodox file manager  
should have - the command prompt. This simple (from  
the user's perspective) feature would extend the file  
manager's capabilities expotentially, and would certainly  
make it far more useful to me. Hell, I would write it  
myself if I knew C++ or anything about how the plugin  
interface works.</detail>

        <detail> It would be nice to get the information which volume a file form a multi-part archive is. I now came across an archive, where ALL parts had the SAME filename (let's say: archive.rar [48 MB], then archive.rar [48 MB], then archive.rar [48 MB], and finally archive.rar [17 MB]), of course all in differnt folders! With 7zip I could not sort out the real order of the files (in fact it were more than just 4 ;-)), because opening each file separately did not give me any information which volume ist should be... 
So I had to go back to WinRAR, which just give the information neede to rename and finally unpack the archive properly! See attached screenshot!</detail>
